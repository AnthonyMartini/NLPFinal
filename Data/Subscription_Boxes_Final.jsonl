was a great activity to do together and he was super engaged with the science behind the reactions .   extremely easy and fun at the same time .   this is an amazing subscription for kids my year old son has so much fun with the experiments i would recommend this to everyone .   just got our first kit and really loved doing the experiments with my daughter she was so excited about following the instructions that are very easily presented both in the book and in the app and seeing the results we ca wait for our box highly recommend .   best chemistry subscription ever we love getting new experiments and the vr app is incredible .   my son is and was quite excited to receive this in the mail i have it come addressed to him and he loves getting the mail to see if it arrived we only received the first kit but enjoyed the two experiments it came with the kit provided everything he needed for the experiment and an extra pair of gloves and glasses which is nice if his brother ever wants to join in on the fun during this social distancing time it nice to give him something to look forward to highly recommend .   really fun easy to follow experiment instructions great activity for the whole house .   the experiments are a great way to inspire the kids about chemistry both my boys and my daughter enjoyed them you get all that you need gloves measuring caps incredible value .   my year old daughter loves both the experiments and the lessons she learning chemistry and enjoying herself too the product is high quality a bit pricey but you get what you paid for .   these kits are great most can do the experiment more than once the glass is good quality the customer service is easy to get ahold of and great for replacing stuff my kids lost or broke we homeschool so i love these kits to enhance our apologia science textbooks .   i have an year old that loves science experiments were included in the first shipment it kept my child very engaged .   i got this for my granddaughter she really likes it her favorite experiment was making the virus she is looking forward to shary the info with her science teacher .   the mel chemistry kit contains everything needed for the experiment including goggles the starter kit also has vr goggles to use the excellent mel chemistry app the first month kit has two experiments the directions are simple and easy to follow i like their version of the carbon snake experiment because it uses much safer chemicals than the version usually seen yet it it still br br the second month kit involves tin metal one experiment makes a dendrite the other a hedgehog both are br br what i like most about the kit is the meticulous attention to detail for example the instructions direct the user to add sodium bicarbonate to the heating fuel to make the flame visible this makes the experiment safer but also opens up a discussion about luminescence the kit also includes thermostickers that can be affixed to all equipment that will be heated eliminating the old saw that hot and cold glassware look alike .   outstanding experience for kids the november box had two experiments and the december box has just arrived the way it is set up is that the first shipment has a starter kit commonly used tools and a first actual subscription items to make experiments while the second and i assume further boxes only have the next br br our first box had the volcano and carbon snake experiments both very easy to do and very impressive setup is great there is a companion app you run on the phone which tells you what to do and there is even a small set for the phone so you do need to hold it while experimenting another nice thing is that they sent more materials than needed for a single try of experiment so you can actually repeat extra br br highly recommended .   we love it it is a bit expensive but once i saw the quality i realized it actually a bargain my kids are so interested in science now and they always have something to look forward to as they send us new experiments once per month .   it s awesome br elephant toothpaste experiment is just the best of chemistry we ve ever br kids are absolutely br waiting for the next parcel with the day marked in our family kitchen br thank you guys .   set the first two experiments are simple but great to catch a kid attention my daughter was excited and engaged then she continued playing in a lab .   my year old loves his kit these kits are a little more sophisticated than other kits we have used he is excited to try the new experiment each month he is able to follow the directions on his own i was very happy with the fast customer service response they replaced the glass flask after my son broke his .

{"PID": "B07XGDM47D", "tokens": "really cute box my only issue is i bought one for my year old and one for my year old both boxes had the exact same crafts my year old thought the crafts were to easy .   my year old loves his box we can t wait for the next one .   this is a great all in one place crafts loved it .   i bought this for a year old and we had a great time with it the only drawback is that there are so many projects in one box and she wants to do them all at once some of the projects are a bit messy and would probably be better for a child in the year old range but it was fun for a rainy afternoon .   this service is on point with the box themes boxes have delivered to my year old nephew and each one is exactly what my nephew is into he loves doing the activities and my sister loves how each activity is individually packed and everything is included i love hearing how excited he is when he calls to tell me what is in the box so impressed with this company and what they create each time .   this has kept our yr old son interested and the little projects are fun .   not only were the kids excited but their parents were impressed with the quality and variety of the kit will stimulate and bring hours of enjoyment well worth the price .   i subscribe to a variety of boxes for my little one this has to be the best one yet the box comes in with six or seven different crafts modeled around one subject each craft is in a clear plastic envelope with items needed for that craft the box also contains any items needed for the crafts that may be to big for the envelope or may be used for several of the projects just very well put together and easy to and create .   you get a lot of activities for the money paid this is excellent value for money br i do have to help my year old with some of the crafts but he absolutely loves it the books included are also a big hit and are perfect for his age and reading br all round excellent box i highly recommend it .   kids from to loved this box every craft wrapped separately so bits do get lost kids loved the crafts .   bought this delightful lil dreamers club box for my granddaughter who is and she absolutely loved it enjoyment laughter for hours she s looking forward to her next box .   our three year old grandson loves getting his projects in the mail the projects within are challenging enough to keep him engaged without frustrating him it helps structure quality time that can be shared with his parents and grandparents sometimes his big brother will jump in as well and that can really make a three year old day .   great kit if you have multiple kids because it is easy to share since there are many activities they are pretty simple but always come with a new set of markers and paint which is great .   so far we have gotten boxes the first one had a space theme the second one was about dinosaurs the third one was about pirates my kid loved every single box he liked building a solar system model and making rockets he liked learning about dinosaurs and he really loved making his own spyglass and boat he needs parental assistance for most of the projects but that br br i like that it comes every months with about projects we do about a week i like that there a variety in types of projects i really like that it keeps him off of watching shows for awhile i do like that coloring pages are sometimes counted as activity it counted in rocket and dinosaur boxes i do like that we accumulating tons of markers are crayons and such full sets of them come in every box and it seems slightly wasteful but those are minor quibbles in an overwhelmingly positive experience .   when i bought this i was just looking for something fun i could do with my year old since he ca be with friends right now and relies on me for of his social needs when i first read the description i expected the activities to be relatively small like sticker sheets and coloring pages it actually did come with stickers and coloring pages but they are even counted at of the crafts br br instead the crafts my son received br design a spaceship a wooden paintable rocket base br design a solar system bamboo skewers and varying sizes of styrofoam balls br color me rocket wind spinner paper rocket and fire blast with a nylon ribbon br coloring and activity sheets coloring pages foam pieces and stickers br solar system sippy cup a sippy cup with inserts br straw rocket paper rocket pipette and straw to make the rocket launch br create an alien ufo paper plate and monster face cutout pieces br br also included supplies br safety scissors br glue stick br water color paint br markers br crayons br br i read the review that mentioned her included cup had spots that would wash off so i added a picture of my son cup ours does appear to have any br safety scissors .   kit was well prepared .   they both enjoyed their kits .

it is really good tea .   great variety of great teas .   this is the best tea ever if you have not tried it you need to all the varieties are magnificent .   loved it .   the first box was fantastic five different varieties of tea and all are so so fresh amazing flavors be sure to use the right temperature for the white and green teas and do oversteep .   i bought vahdam tea as as a gift for three granddaughters they love this tea one said she adds nothing to the tea and it is yummy .   love the tea and selection but it takes long to ship because it comes from india i will continue to buy the teas because they are amazing but i won t continue the subscription .   the teas were fresh and delicious but the most amazing part was that the seller shipped the box of teas using priority shipping arriving to the us from india in just one business day .   loving the tea variety very high quality and a great price love that it comes directly from india to my home in ky .   the first teas they sent are delicious i love chai and this particular recipe is really good i not a connoisseur but found that the black teas are smooth and the green tea nice and nutty the turmeric herbal spice reminds me of their delicious chai without the caffeine the box is sturdy and well made easy to use with the magnetic closure i am the only tea drinker in the family and do drink it every day so i had to space out the shipments happy with my purchase .   i bought this subscription as a gift for my wife since she is a tea lover we tried the rose flavored black tea from the pack and we are impressed with the freshness and beautiful aroma i will highly recommend this tea .   purchases subscription of this tea as a christmas gift for my husband he is definitely enjoying so i will continue the subscription .   my wife sits at night with her blanket and a cup of this tea she feels special and looks like it while sipping this tea .   it was a gift and they were delighted .   i gifted my husband this tea subscription as a christmas gift we are not big tea drinkers but due to working at home and the cold weather setting in he started to drink more tea throughout the day i saw the vadam teas advertised and thought the subscription plan would be an ideal gift since opening the box we have both had a great time sampling the teas the quality is evident and the flavors pleasing the only negative is that we are now spoiled and will not return to our typical teas we look forward to receiving our next box .   i liked that this subscription had hard to find flavors but to me it was a bit pricey unless you really like tea .   i m very impressed with the quality of the teas that i received this is my first box so i can only review this particular box but it is so promising that i felt like writing this review anyways first of all i ve found it difficult to find a good quality tea and my personal opinion is that you have to have a loose tea to get the best flavor all of the five packets are absolutely amazing my personal absolute favorite is original chai i can go farther and say that i would love to receive it in each and every subscription it is that good i am addicted to it all the others were also outdstanding but this one just hit home i used the instructions from the pamphlet to brew it with milk just an br additionally i wanted to comment on the outstanding service the teas came from india and the shipment went out in less than hours and received it within a week california very impressive already looking forward to the next shipment thank you .   great tea i like to support them over others .   i drink a lot of tea and i been drinking tea for a good many years i even worked for a tea company for a while and had an endless supply of fresh tea in the office i use quotes there because that tea was nearly as fresh as this tea and it makes a huge difference i really enjoying the different blends and i already identified a couple that i want to follow up on with a larger order if you love tea and want a subscription box this is a great option .   there was delicious great value for as much tea i got .   i love tea but so far the blends they ve created just aren t for me overall good value if you like the teas wonderful packaging .   i loving the new tea i get each month there are so many different ones to try i months in and have loved all of the tea i received so far enough flavors that i do get bored with any .   i love simplifying my huge collection if teas down to this wounderful loose leaf br i also love the directions on each label .   quite lovely enjoying it .   this might honestly be the best loose leaf supplier i have tried to this day as soon as i opened each bag i knew i was in for a treat out of best quality and great value your mission statement shines through in your product and packaging .

year old grandson loved learning it he is now and always looks forward to getting it .   my grandson is learning coding at school and wanted more for home this fills the bill .   my grandson is obsessed with this he was at the computer for over hours and we had to tear him away .   the best decision i made my son loves the activities and is so proud of himself to be coding .   i sent this to my grandchildren they loved it cant wait for next box .   bitsbox is educational challenging enjoyable for my kids .   this is a great product it is pricey for what you get but i think it is ultimately worth it .   it depends on the child you buy it for i got it for a kid who admittedly is a nerd and he loves it .   my year old loves this and i love learning along with him .   my kids enjoy working on the different coding projects in this subscription .   purchased for my year old brother and he loved it he was proud of himself and was excited to show people the games he was able to create he s looking forward to his next box .   excellent program for kids to get started .   my daughter was delighted to hear about this and for me to get it for my year old granddaughter they had already tried a coding project were happy to hear about this ongoing delivery of more advanced shipments it is not really really expensive but according to them well worth it costs coding is the way of the future .   saw this on the shark tv show and wanted to get it for my grandson who will be yrs in he loves it and already started coding his parents are learning coding with him .   i was really surprised to see my daughter was coding the apps from the box in minutes it was so fun and through doing the coding exercises she was starting to understand the syntax and how the different parts fit together there are so many small and engaging details she is hooked .   started coding with my kids last night and it so much fun they are learning and we have been laughing a lot i did it with my year old and year old and they both had a great time .   highly recommended my daughter opened it and never looked back we can t wait for the next box to come .   my year old grandson is enjoying the monthly boxes very much .   i bought this for my nephew but decided to see if the my older graders summer campers wanted to try bitbox they loved it hopefully they will all get subscriptions this year for gifts they begged to do my bitbox each week my and graders saw what was happening and they jumped in for some coding fun definitely recommend for upper elementary and up .   my son enjoys coding these the creators found just the right amount of challenge and entertainment .   the kid is in love with learning to code she is doing a great job following along with the instructions she s and is enjoying making the apps one of the best features is that you can share the apps with friends .   my son is we spent time reading everything together the first box but after that he ran with it he loves getting his new box and watching the animation move his words it the best .   my nieces love bitbox they were surprised with what it is .   it was simple enough for an advanced year old girl to immediately learn how to type in the code but how to change the code to make fun shapes appear and even controlling the coordinates on the screen so the shapes appear where you want them fun .   love this subscription box it is so appealing to my children due to the clear instructions they literally do not need my help within a day they see customizing and creating their own apps love this .   the packaging is good and our year old daughter really likes the coding projects one thing i really like is how exact the codes have to be to work and the coloring of the code to make bugs stand out i am taking off one star for the combination of shipping taking longer than we would have liked and also for having to sign up for a subscription to order the first box .   one of the best subscription for children my years old was instantly hooked and loves his daily programming time .   my and year old have had hours of fun exploring their bit box this is a wonderfully engaging way to introduce coding they have worked both individually and together we can not wait for the next one to arrive .   my daughter gets so excited to get her new coding box it keeps her interested .   the product is a big hit in my house the kids were able to complete the first set in one day due to how fun it was to do the parental guide does help to instruct the parents on what the set will teach the kids i highly recommend this easy to teach programming subscription i sure wish they had one for cooking .

offering the smuggler s bounty kinda disappointed there was no shirt however the two shot glasses made up for it not to mention the rotj lando and klaatu a favorite because of my costume back in october of .   packed very well both items were gifts for a collector and the product within was pristine .   i sorry others are upset but this box is awesome babu frik is one of the best parts of the new movie and i was dying to get my hands on his funko is super cute too rey is one of my absolute favorite star wars characters so seeing her on the shirt and the decal made me smile crazy big i am not disappointed in the least sad to see this box go as i love collecting these smuggler bounty boxes .   fast and well shipped awsome product will continue with my subscription i am very pleased with my smugglers bounty box .   i read several reviews before signing up for this subscription and finally decided to give it a go though many people seemed to complain that it was as good since amazon took over i really enjoyed opening and discovering the box the shirt is really cute love the glass and the pop and are both really cute if you do like doofy funko i do then you wo like this so do bother .   these pops look so good they look great with my collection box also came with a little ani pin and a shirt .   though there was no in this jabba skiff edition i felt like funko really stepped up to the plate two pops with skiff lando and klaatu the jabba mystery mini two fun holders that are more shot glasses than anything and a nifty luggage tag i felt like i got my money worth with this box .   the star wars wookie theme smuggler bounty box has a nice assortment of quality items many full size that make it a good value and fun collectible for star wars funko pops fans alike some smuggler bounty boxes are not well stocked or have lower quality items this box is a good one to get i would have liked to have seen two full sized star wars pops or a movie scene pop instead of a standard single pop the and full size glass are solid items in a subscription box if all the smuggler bounty subscription boxes were like this one with the addition of another full size pop or a single movie scene pop they would be a no brainer for collectors and casual fans looking for cool star wars merchandise not commonly found in stores hopefully this trend of well stocked quality item boxes will continue .   to be honest i did not open this box i did not open the last few boxes since i like to keep them intact i watched videos later on to see what s inside i m a star wars collector so i don t open the items i will write the same reviews for the other smugglers bounty boxes .

 the concept is great but i feel it was lacking actual activities for the kids to do my daughter is and i feel it was a good age range for her but the letter it comes with i had to read most of it because it was a little over her head and overwhelming she did love the passport and we took a photo to put inside and she is so happy she now has a passport like mommy and daddy it s cute and the concept is great but it was lacking in fun .   my daughter loved it we ca wait to see what adventures arrive in next months package the suitcase was nice and sturdy she loved the squishy animals that came in the first box .   perfect great way to have fun and learn .   in a world of too many toys and screens this is the perfect monthly kit i love the educational value and activities in it and my year old daughter loves receiving the monthly present and learning about each new country she is always eager to do the craft project right when her little passports arrives a perfect gift for thru graders .   my daughter waits every month to get the box it keeps her busy for atleast a couple of days i love the fact that she is now learning about the countries on her own .   my granddaughter was thrilled to receive the world addition she loved her passport and the animals of the world we ca wait or the next box i am very well pleased so far thank you also your response to my emails was right on spot quick and wait .   i gave little passports to my granddaughter for christmas after hearing about the product from her mom it is a great gift that helps kids learn about other cultures countries and people she loved it and her younger brother and sister have been able to enjoy using parts of it too .   my daughter started receiving these last christmas and always looks forward to getting her package each month she loves to read the letter from sam and sophia each month to see what they ve been up to the only reason i didn t give it stars is because it is kind of pricey .   my granddaughter loves receiving a new country every month she s learning so much about other cultures and the world .   exposure to the world for a curious future traveler .   my kids love this they love learning about other cultures seeing the different souvenirs from the different countries and they can t wait to get there next package every month .   my children ages and really enjoyed the kit it something special that we are doing together each month and there were activities for both of them it is geared for one child which is a little disappointing because it would be way too expensive to buy more than one kit per household but we were able to mostly up the activities and the little prizes that came with it all in all it took about an hour to read everything and do the activities later that night the kids even recalled specific facts they learned and talked about it at bedtime we are excited for our next box .   my soon to be year old looks forward to it monthly it s is a bit pricey but she really enjoys it it s definitely a grandparents gift she want the science but we can t afford that amount .   my daughter has been begging for the suitcase surprise box for awhile so i m excited to give this to her for christmas i looked through it and everything seems like really great quality will be perfect for homeschooling too .   my grandson loves these but the shipping is outrageously slow each one is supposed to ship on the of the month but it doesn t arrive until the seventh or eighth of the following product you would probably be better off ordering directly from the company .   my grandkids love this it s great to know they re having fun and building upon the knowledge gained from each successive shipment from their grandparents my daughter in law is very involved in making sure they get the most out of it love her too .

socks my husband enjoys getting packages in the mail especially now that he is staying home most of the time because of the pandemic the monthly delivery is something fun for him to look forward to thank you .   these socks are not very thick which i really like they have fun colors and are breathable high quality .   i received my first pair of socks a couple of weeks ago these socks were colorful and playful as well as extremely comfortable i am looking forward to my monthly subscription and can not wait until the next pair arrives great way to increase my sock drawer without needing to go out to the store to purchase great value and well worth the subscription .   i love how soft colorful and ever so kitchey the only thing i don t care for is the threading on the interior of the sock my toenails get stuck in the you will so i would rate these lovely socks a can t wait to see the next pair .   i accidentally put in for a sock subscription but will say the pair i did get are very very nice and comfy and may just have to resubscribe after the holidays lol .   i bought this for my adult son who lives away from home and he raves about the quality of the socks he loves the interesting patterns too also great that there is a giveback portion to our philadelphia community .   the socks were a gift for my secret pal so i haven t worn them but they felt really good and they were super cute she was thrilled .   what a beautiful quality product and to say that about a pair of socks speaks br this was a fun and perfect gift to give someone for birthday or father day he looks forward to his new pair every month .   my kids are in college and are having for the first time in their lives buy their own clothes as they wear out this is pure hilarity to me mah did you know socks can get holes in them therefore i purchased this gift subscription for one of my daughters in college it a double gift the socks are hilarious plus they serve a purpose .   we loved our first pair great quality fun colorful print .   i bought this as a fathers day present my husband loves the monthly subscription at first he seemed underwhelmed worried that it s a lot of socks but the truth he goes they a lot of socks now he has a fresh replacement every and they are really high quality colorful attractive socks it s a small moment of delight whenever they arrive i only wish i had gotten the short tall socks because in the summer of covid he isn t really wearing tall socks because he isn t going to the office never the less we re loving the tall ones he will wear them in the fall .   my husband loves them the only thing is the crew length is longer than a regular crew length i was under the impression that crew length was at the mid calf and they reach the upper calf my husband is tall so it should hit mid calf otherwise he loves them nice designs as well amazing packaging he is loving them and told me they are soft comfortable not too thick and not too thin high quality i suggest you order them they make for a nice surprise every month .   my husband has only received one pair so far but he adores them .   they have so many colors and patterns that you can easily match any your outfit or theme i choose their red white and blue socks to match my patriotic outfits .   wow it the word that comes to my mind about this company their socks i decided to give my father an annual subscription for the once a month crew socks for christmas oh my i do think i seen him as excited as he been with these socks lol for a few decades he been known about town for sharing his style by wearing shorts it fl so yeah wild socks when he got his first pair he not only loved the style but said they were the most comfortable well made socks he ever owned he so that

{"PID": "B07DX25MZK", "tokens": "delicious my husband and i loved the tea .   it came with a decent amount of good quality tea for the price ive tried all the teas and they all taste great .   the package the tea came in was very well designed and stylish the box it was shipped in was the shipper so there was no wasted material when you open the box the tea is wrapped in one layer of tissue paper all the teas come in standard foil sealed packages with the different brewing instructions on each pack .   i have had a subscription since the very beginning to say i am a fan is putting it mildly the tea is delicious there is a really good variety each month i am never bored the teas come from all over the world and each have a distinct flavor i started with the original box then moved to the all black and now i am enjoying the pure tea box i am never br br i have also reached out to customer service several times and they have always been prompt and professional .   for real people if you like tea at all this subscription box is amazing each month they have a really interesting variety of blends and each bag tells you how much to use how long to steep it for whether it caffeine and i never tasted a loser seriously i been getting this for or months now and every time it like christmas because i know i going to love what they have know that it is loose leaf tea so if you do already have one you want to procure a roomy tea ball to hold the tea while it steeps in your mug i been very glad i subscribed to this box and i recommended it to others buy this tea .   only drank so far and i was not a chai tea drinler before but i like the variety offered .   this tea is excellent i spent a few days trying to decide if it was worth the cost and hassle of a monthly subscription i finally decided to give the original box a try figuring i could cancel if anything i received my first box of tea after only a few days in very nice packaging upon opening i was greeted by foil front pouches with descriptions ingredients and instructions for brewing when i picked one up and turned it over i let out an audible gasp of surprise the beauty of these teas and the fullness of the leaves were stunning i tried the lemon ginger yerba mate first it was absolutely exquisite next i tried the wild thai black and it was rich and wonderful in the photos i have included the front and backs of the packaging a close up of the lemon ginger yerba mate and the inside of the bag of the next tea i am brewing blueberry rooibos .   i went into this subscription with no knowledge in brewing my own tea tea runners provide a tasty selection each month and made it easy enough for a complete to understand .   overall i have enjoyed the teas there has only been one tea that i didn t like the only thing i wish is on the original box there was one option a month that is caffeine free i like to drink tea all day but i can t drink caffeine late at night .   loved these teas i originally purchased only because of the special price for the subscription but i think i m going to keep my subscription the flavors are great i m very impressed .   i will say that i not much of a tea connoisseur i always kind of liked tea but never knew much about it i recently received my second box but the first one has been amazing thus far the variety has kind of kept me on my toes and they include information so you do scorch and ruin tea leaves it been nice to learn as the first few cups i botched a little due to inexperience i also live at a very high altitude and need to keep that in mind as it affects the temperatures at which water br br as i figured out how long to heat up my water for each package of tea i been able to taste and notice a lot more subtleties in each variety they all also been refreshing something else of note is that the packaging for each tea is pretty good too i can usually smell sealed items easily but i ca really smell anything when these teas are still sealed .   i received my first tea runners box and was pleasantly surprised to start i love the portable zip lock you can take it anywhere second each individual packet gives brewing instructions and caffeine levels last but certainly not least is the selection i received different teas of different origins and flavors white peach earl grey rooibos jalinga estate assam wild thai green all unique delicious br okay wait one last important thing is the quality the tea leaves are whole not crushed and the smell from the bag is amazing but the taste is br i would highly recommend this product to friends and br update charlie ritchie tea runner contacted me directly concerning a billing error on their end that i had not caught that s true customer service .

comics were also in great condition considering the package was stuffed in my br br if you purchase this subscription do like i did and reply to the message from the company with title preferences and who the box is for as soon as br br enjoy .   this is a fantastic assortment of comics and a good value for the money i enjoyed the assortment of different titles i received and all comics were in great condition .   i bought this subscription for my husband birthday he loves it he ca wait for the next month box .   the subscription box has a decent selection the titles that came in the box are one that interests me .   i got my first box very happy with it and only would like to have the flash and teenage mutant ninja turtles added to the choices .   perfect gift for my grandsons to share and become better readers .   my husband absolutely loved the comics that came in the box every comic was a character that he loved only one marvel comic was mixed in which is a big deal it just my husband and i are dc fans still the perfect gift .   son loves it .   great selection of product .   my son loves these and i love how the company reaches out to try to send the characters he likes the most amazing customer service .   i am super happy with this purchase the seller seems to really care about choosing the right comics for the buyer it is important to message the curator to let them know what you like of course i am excited to see what the comic garage will send next month .   i loved that my son could pick the characters he interested in and we got a good variety of the ones he picked .   just getting back into collecting comics for the time i went pretty deep on my favorite characters and was pretty specific about my love of marvel the provided selection was spot on the value of the comics i received was well over the subscription price pretty stoked for the next box fyi comics have never really been made for children yes they exist but that s not really the target audience in most cases .   i have to say for the people that complained about the comics they are insane because i have had all great comics at great quality and price i love that they give me old and new comics with the specific ones i chose .   this is exactly what i asked for in terms of what imagine the perfect surprise box of comics to be after i told them some of my favorite characters i got it this box was better than the last which was better than the last thank you for putting thought into these thank you again and only half through the box right now .   with myself being new to comics this subscription is a great way for me to start a collection i had been wanting to for a while and i saw this product and decided to try it out each comic is in great shape and packaged well i enjoyed this so much that i changed to the larger option for these comics i would recommend this as a great gift or if you just want to treat yourself this is a great product to do so .   very well packaged great selections based on my suggestions wish their was sleeves on the comics but not going to complain for the price stars .   this is a great idea to start or add to collections .   my grandchildren are thrilled to receive their own box and look forward to it each and every time i could have found a better gift according to the grands .   got this for my dad it s been almost a year and he is still loving them .   this is one the friendliest comic book company i ve ever purchased from the subscription box is an excellent gift option we have loved opening and reading the comics from the boxes customer service is phenomenal i would highly recommend .   thank you my year old son loved it .   if you are looking into getting into comics this is an absolute great way to start and if you re already into comics then this is a fantastic way to continue the products themselves are in pristine condition and i got i good mix of both dc and marvel comics marvel and dc i really like getting the wide array of comics because its helping me figure out what comics i want to focus on collecting specifically from my box i really enjoyed my cable and batman comics .   awesome collections of comics from marvel and dc comics from all different decades gold silver etc br br would be awesome if they have more comic books publishers and multilingual languages options to choose when subscribing to comics br br they should make a better packaging and easier to open packaging that the comics comes br br i ca wait to read and see what next month comics is going to be and read them when received in my mail .

are delicious .   we love our coffee and so far received some really nice samples of both coffee and cookies .   wow the coffees and cookies are sooo delicious what a treat to get this every and the suspense of what flavor the coffee and cookie will be br i love this is what i call real .   coffee and cookies really are perfectly paired also there s plenty of coffee to last several days for me anyway and the cookies are not your classics like chocolate chip and whatnot they are original love this subscription .   passed this forward and they were pleased .   i was glad i discontinued a monthly coffee subscription for this duo i enjoyed both the coffee and the cookies last month and looking forward to a treat in a few days .   in my never ending search for more and more and more organic coffee i stumbled into this subscription box i tried other subscription coffees on amazon those that will not be named here but they did not offer organic coffee with one service you may get organic coffee from time to time and with the other service there was just no br the idea of getting cookies paired with a great roast of organic coffee seems like a perfect combo with the only negative thing being that it leaves me wanting more and more and more br the cookies are always bakery fresh and individually sealed they are a decent size and always taste amazing every cookie that i have had to date from this service is always fresh delicious and leaves me wanting br the coffee is where it at and was my main focus while i do not like any flavored coffee i always love trying different roasts of coffee from different places it amazes me how coffee can taste so different even though from the outside it just coffee it fun getting a box with bright green shredded paper for packaging every month filled with small packages which is now bigger package of coffee and br the coffee comes freshly ground and sealed in the pouch i do notice any valves on these pouches to release the gas that ground coffee can emit but given that it is so freshly ground and you will probably drink it up fast i guess this is a big deal i believe the coffee would last a year as they do seem to be vacuum sealed with no room for anything to get in there or out until you break open the seal and inhale the fragrant freshly roasted coffee i do think there is any better smell than ground coffee maybe fresh baked cookies no on second thought coffee smells better and is so much better for you usually depending on how you enjoy your coffee .   it s fun to anticipate the arrival of the pairing the kenyan coffee this month is good but unremarkable the cookie is balsamic and rosemary with a little black pepper it works but i don t think i ve met a cookie i didn t like i m already looking forward to the arrival of december s box .   the coffees are good and do show a nice variety if you go by the standardized cup markings on the side of most coffee pots i got about cups out of each packet it would probably be about half that number in coffee mugs i use about a scoop for every two cups i make if you like your coffee stronger you get less out of packet despite the fact that they are i do have any complaints about freshness the bags are sealed at least as well as any commercial coffee and are according to the company freshly ground a few days before you receive br br update when this review was written you got packets each with a different coffee per month and each packet made cups a matched cookie was included for each packet now you get packet per month that makes about cups and two cookies of the same type it the same amount of stuff you got before but the single larger quantity match may be more convenient for br br the cookies are very good for a packaged cookie and have an interesting combination of ingredients making them a bit more unique than a simple chocolate chip or sugar cookie they seem to be a fresh baked cookie that is sealed in a plastic wrapper and then shipped by the time they get to you they have dried out a little but they are still very good as for size they just a little bit smaller than the rim of a plain white coffee mug that not huge but it more than br br my only complaint is that it took a full weeks after the date that amazon placed the order for the package to arrive for a company that seems to be trying to ship a fresh product that a little slow i not sure how much this is impacting the freshness but it is a br br note that my order date was even earlier amazon places the orders once a month which means your order is also delayed until about the of the month i not complaining about because it does affect the freshness of the product i gather it made fresh after the amazon order is placed you do have to be very aware of the total time frame if you planning to make a gift of this though .   my mother in law loves getting hers every month always a surprise what kind will arrive and my father in law enjoys the cookies with her .

fun for my dogs to they loved it .   dogs loved the treats havent used the other products yet .   i was pleasantly surprised i was pleased with the gloves and waterless shampoo my dog liked the treats and toys .   all the products included were great our dog was very happy and so were we .   liked everything in the box did need shampoo at the time but will use it eventually .   loved all of the products i received .   the box is filled with toys snacks and hygeine for your dog my dog is now older so i gave the toys to my grandogter a dobie my dog loved the treats everything was useful for a month plus shipping it is well worth it if you priced the items in the box separately in a store the contents in the box together is huge discount i would estimate the contents combined each month were over and up .   my dogs absolutely loved the treats but there was very little in each bag they also liked the toys some of the literature wasnt nesessary .   the fetchbox has a classy feel to it smaller actual box than some competitors but the contents were all high quality not just stuff trying to fill up a box contents included very useful human things too like the the gloves and shampoo some companies just have dog treats and toys so to me this box is the best i have found so far for the price .   i was mostly pleased with this box my only issue is i have a lb yellow lab and some of the toys were very small and the chew said for dogs under lbs i do know if this company takes information such as dogs size into account however he does love the small toys so it the toys were cute and the burt bees waterless shampoo is great .   i got my box this month and the product inside is amazing it all good brands and very useful stuff i checked online and only of the products are worth thank you fetchbox pebbles pepper thank you tons br br just got my box truy amazing value wow .   we received our fetch box and was very pleased the dental toy is amazing my girl usually destroys toys and especially chew toys but she really likes this one it feels good on her gums everything was great and they are items i will br br thank you .   we got the february box it was dental month so everything was dental themed there was a large chew toy that is too big for my chewer and it has a bad smell the dogs like the dental chews but that s about it we don t need the included toothbrush toothpaste or fingerbrushes we have dental stuff the box also included a water additive for plaque and dental spray i doubt we will use these i ll give it another month to see if march includes more for the dogs to enjoy .   my pup loved what was in it i felt it was worth the price a couple cheap treats a cheap toy that lasted about an br i would have spent for it at .   i like this box alot but it probably features more goodies for humans than dogs .   i was very impressed with this box for the price i did expect it to be so full i definitely feel that i got a good value my havanese lucy loves the turbopup treats i would buy them again the burt bees oatmeal shampoo is also excellent i usually need to use conditioner but this shampoo worked very well without needing it the brush that came with the box is very good quality much better than the one i had been using in the past i had been disappointed with boxes because they are as good as they look in the photo the fetchbox was actually better i am very happy with my purchase .   box was smaller than i expected but had great items for all of our dogs looking forward to future shipments .   true to advertisement from the products to the courteous friendly representatives who are too happy to make you happy and your furry friend happier .   this is a great way to try out new products you may or may not have bought on your own i have tried out a few new bones and treats that do seem to be healthy and my dog loves them there are products that i recieved that i knew straight away my dog would like and there are products i thought my dog would like but turns out she likes them it goes hand in hand you do know if you will like it untill you try it as for the products my dog did like i will be taking it to the animal shelter .   the box was a great way to try new products without wasting a lot of money there were grooming products and treats only my dog has loved all the treats and it gave me a chance to let him try something i would not normally buy him the grooming products are nice specially the burt bee wipes however he wanted nothing to do with the aerosol can of dry shampoo he sees it and runs i dropped one star because i was really hoping for some type of toy to be included but there was not log my spoiled dog needed another toy but again he is spoiled and i like to give me new squeaky toys

i don t have to go to the store and buy it all this is a great deal and value i m sending him to preschool so i must cancel but i think i will be back .   we love these crates each contains three main activities relating to the monthly theme the activities are age appropriate and educational the directions are always very clear and the materials are high quality it is so great to have everything included it is much easier and cheaper than finding an activity on pinterest and attempting to gather the supplies on your own also your preschooler can do some of the activities over and over again the owner of this small business puts her heart and soul into these boxes and it shows i sent these as gifts for my nieces and nephews and they also loved them i highly recommend supporting a small business and ordering tinkering toddler crates you will not be disappointed .   great projects boxes are sent with several different project about a different subjects each month boxes include most needed materials every project is packaged and labeled there instructions and additional extra project suggestions sometimes the boxes are heavy and some light depending on the br br the project are age appropriate and are even fun for parents a great go to for homeschooling .   we love ttc they are original in creativity and well made with quality supplies the activities are educational and fun a perfect play based approach to learning they are a great way to keep your child developmentally on track each one comes with a development chart for age which is always good to have the crafts are really fun and make for great pinterest and ig moments more importantly your child ren will have a blast while being introduced to new learning arts and crafts that are appropriate for year olds we have been a subscriber to these for three years and both of my children have really enjoyed them you can tell the is passionate and puts a lot of thought into creating each one they have been something to look forward to monthly through this pandemic .   my daughter loves the projects i love the convenience of it all everything is included with the exception of general household items bowls ice water i wish there was extra project in the box would be great that allow us to do about per week .   i bought this box for my daughter i saw it on ch news and jumped on line to get it this box is helpful great ideas for kids best investment i made my child gets so excited to put projects together i do one project a week if you are trying to mix it up with this at home learning that we have to do this would be a great option the fact that everything comes in the box is just awesome i would give it more stars if i could highly recommended .   i purchase these for my niece her husband and my great nephew both my niece and her husband have really heavy work schedules and i wanted something that would allow their time with their son to be quality time these boxes are so enabling they seem to be full of the types of projects any parent would want to do with their kids but all the thought that needs to go into to preparing creative projects is already done instead of spending their time collecting ingredients for fun projects they can use their limited time interacting with their son and just doing the projects and enjoying their time together both parents rave about these boxes and i consider the money really well spent .   good for a bored year old at br these projects keeps the littles engaged for an afternoon or br br some plastic waste some br br it open and play you do have to gather up stuff which saves time it pretty creative and adds some variety to kid projects .   a family member we do know who got a subscription for my year old we are on our second box and she has been having a great time getting messy looking forward to cracking the dinosaur eggs and erupting the volcano later thank you to whomever got this awesome gift subscription for us .

love the serendipity of getting new items every month in a time of social distancing cairn has helped fill that void of not being able to wander the aisles of my favorite outdoor store and find cool new gear i love the care given to the design and the thought put into the theme of every box can t wait to see what comes next month .   it was a birthday surprise for my hubby and he really loves the quality of products included and that every month his bday keeps coming win win .   it s it s the first thing i open when i have a stack of mail and it s in there always look forward to seeing what s new and reading the paper they provide about the products the companies and the why i have gone to some of these and bought other products the company makes is it bug out bag climb a volcano products no it is some cool stuff sometimes though true outdoor people may enjoy the smile this subscription box brings .   got ta say i had to hide this collection from the husband and kids when it came in the mail really high quality gear that i will put to use right away already used the insulated bottle for my coffee this week at work i wasn t familiar with some of the brands and products so it was nice they included a little newspaper explaining the products theme of the box and some cool pictures .   a subscription to cairn is like the gift that keeps on giving for people who love outdoor adventure just opening the box is exciting but then getting to try out new gear and snacks inspires you to get out more i discovered brands and products i would have never thought of that are now part of every camping trip and even tried some things like cricket bars that were surprisingly delish .   getting a surprise delivery like this is so much fun and the products i got in my first box are things that i basically use every day except for the picky bar i ate that right away i was super impressed with the value too the sunglasses alone were worth double the price of the box definitely a fan i be sticking around for a long time .   this box is amazing every box is a new collection cool items everything from everyday useful items like battery banks to fun gadgets you ve never heard of to new flavors of already beloved bars the actual boxes are classy and its arrival always makes for a great day .   i been a big fan of cairn for a few years now and have always wanted to subscribe finally i was able to purchase my first box and i have to say i love it the sunglasses i received are badass and already proving to be useful as the summer quickly approaches what i love about cairn over other subscription box companies is that they really value our evnironment and doing what is necessary to limit their carbon footprint and help give back was just recently reading about their gear up give back program and it programs like this that make me want to follow and be involved with a company thanks again and keep the awesome products coming .   i received my first items from cairn awesome knife pack towel and banana protein snacks for any activity on the go very impressed i m not sure what some of these other customers are looking for for great job cairn .   i have been getting this gift box for about five years it is christmas every month some months better than others overall get much more value items than the monthly charge geared for the outdoors person i enjoy it very much .   my wife and i share the items we get in our cairn boxes and she loved the sunski sunglasses this month she has been wanting a pair of polarized sunski and boom they showed up each month it a surprise you never know what you going to get .   i have been receiving a cairn box for over two years and have been exposed to so many unique products that have become favorites and i otherwise never would have known about them i use my cotapaxi backpack regularly my hydroflask cups reef safe sunscreen the fun patches for my gear the fun sunglasses it is like a treat that is better and cheaper than my local coffee store every day i also love their email newsletter .   love this company the food that comes with these boxes is always fun and products i go looking for after a while back i got one of those hammocks love that thing anytime year overall its just nice getting gifts from a company that seems to put actual thought into what they send rather than just a hand full of cheap crap looking forward to summer and cairn boxes that keep me outdoors .   i found the mix of products interesting i have not been able to try them out yet but all look useful .   cairn is curated gear by real outdoor folks using these products on a daily basis every month i am pleasantly surprised with new gear that i integrate into my arsenal it useful fun and is absolutely the best day of every month rad company doing rad things you wo be disappointed .   just received my first cairn box excellent selection of items i had seen before including a phenomenal insulated bottle great job
