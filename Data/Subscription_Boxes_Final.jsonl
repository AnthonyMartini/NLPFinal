product they sent me great first looking forward next one \n minute saw that there was specifically red heads signed up get look forward getting each month products are always good love diversity in each \n love february truly love this subscription this month chella lipstick is so pretty just redheads us redheads have unique quality about ourselves items are tuned in what redheads need want \n love this look forward surprises brings every month products are absolutely perfect redhead but also really any person with fair skin some sample products from have turned into daily items while other products are just fun try have fair sensitive skin but have not had bad reaction any products received totally worth price as you much more back than you are spending \n got this as gift have been hooked on ever since is so exciting get full fun red head related beauty products every month great way learn about new products great price amount things you get can tell that this brand was started by red heads because all usable items that help out redheads are really fun have ten out ten would recommend \n absolutely love how be redhead subscription boxes s packed with new amazing products try as well as some recurring favourites look forward every month \n love these they really fit me learn more on how keep skin hair soft \n love getting monthly surprise boxes there are always something awesome that didn t know what product that needed in life \n wife loves products they send she is discovering what she really likes \n loved everything that came in can t wait next one \n love these subscription boxes love getting try new products ones that are specifically red hair are always awesome this was first monthly had gotten deluxe before fell head over heels so many products in this february particularly love lip pencil night moisturizer was kind bummed that there wasn t any eyeshadow or brow products since those are always ones struggle choose but continuing subscription anyway can t wait next deluxe \n just love boxes subscribe monthly deluxe boxes through boxes have been introduced many new me products which have in turn added usual beauty routine really appreciate this subscription plus their customer service is wonderful \n was gift someone but looks great \n love this so much first was full size products was super impressed second was well less exciting but still filled with some great products got today omg more full size products was also chosen be one that received special product just that one item paid two times over am keeping this subscription as long as keep receiving such amazing full size products they really know what they are doing when choosing products be sent out also received sweet anne green gables book just icing on cake if you re on fence about this subscription then please take word order you won t be disappointed \n love this subscription get monthly deluxe sometimes monthly boxes seem little scarce with mostly sample sized products but ve found some products in these boxes would purchase again also got red liquid lipstick few boxes ago that get compliments on every time wear br br ve been subscriber monthly since day one \n think could have been more red head friendly but products received were usable valued pretty high \n products that come are new easy use not just sample its whole bottle or package whatever comes in definitely worth money would say this is red heads specifically not really is just geared toward women who are sensitive skinned \n would recommend this subscription anyone considering purely based on their customer service well products are pretty cool too m not gon na lie however when came this month one products had leaked was half empty contacted seller received quick response let me know that they were me item that they sincerely apologized me this is so much more valuable than items that came in we spend our hard earned money on things that we enjoy really helps know that brand stands behind their products their customers they even threw in an extra product secured lid so that same problem did not happen again that can really appreciate \n wife loved did not know how would go but she was so surprised got her she absolutely loved \n awesome product \n not bad price value just not pleased with items none was actually specific redhead products just things facial skin care stuff shampoo conditioner is color treated hair am natural red head none this is really useful me was hoping makeup products that compliment redhair there were none very br br kept subscription one more month was pleased with august had different oils travel size shampoos conditioners that were all natural made redheads there was also an eyeshadow palette plan keep subscription now maybe first got just was right fit br great next month \n liked lot really but did get three types sunblock in first package but so much fun having mystery items shipped you \n"}

chews are pretty small but toys are such great quality they have ripped one yet that saying something also so cute \n dogs love barkbox they get excited when they see toys actually last while compared

ready play with something new its great way keep them occupied from being bored \n can you tell how happy she is with her bark subscription great \n bought this as gift dogs liked tje treats but will cancel subscription because there are not enough toys \n do know how they make these toys but they are practically indestructible dogs usually destroy toy within minutes seriously there is cream filling everywhere but these toys last am on bark first toys are still as good as new dogs play with them all time are by far their favorites they have different textures make different noises that dogs love you have try this \n have great danes this is large dogs gifts are still way too small \n dog likes lot \n great set every month always different dogs love \n we love getting our barkbox

like play hard with them really enjoy these squeaky toys we have had few weeks now so far they hold up well treats are fine just felt that overall you could purchase toys treats less which course is always case if you want take time shop if you like convenience do have time shop then recommend barkbox as time saver time is money as they say \n got with first time discount so value was great dog usually rips toys up so fast but first one gave him only got partially torn up at first would have liked option get super chewer through amazon but quality what we got with regular was great \n dog chewed toys apart in about minutes but he just loves squeakers saved money by only giving him these toys instead always buying new ones \n dog loves its good price good stuff \n"}

small they liked all toys but would like more toys \n such cute toys little expensive but so cute first was under sea themed cats loved all toys \n would love have photo but cats went crazy they loved \n this was such treat kitty so much fun \n cat went nuts food toys were adorable \n kitties love meow days toys are so cute love themes cats treats however have not been best last three treats cats will not touch but they sure do love their toys \n videoid love themes there are fun toys yummy snacks they come in cat loves everything about meowbox \n love they love br have picky kitties so got one without treats they will only really play with toys that jingle smell strongly catnip these definitely do \n was amazing great quality toys christmas themed december cat loved this she s played all day with toys haven t seen her so active in very long time m very pleased with this will be continuing subscription \n very much worth money always has plenty things cat enjoy from treats toys \n dont think cats liked many treats some they devoured littlest cat was at time too small treats anyway they never play with toys but sure liked getting showing all stuff cats interacting with them \n videoid babies are super picky they loved every toy they liked handmade toys even year old kitty loved toys played with them definitely going keep subscription \n enjoyed watching cat turn into kitty again when he played with catnip toys \n cats loved they had so much fun playing with toys they know what looks like but also helps that come in door saying your meow came today they run into bedroom jump on bed because that is where we open they love toys but quit getting treats neither one by fur babies like treats so we just go toys \n both cats loved they toys in this one they each had favorite one had eventually take away hide so could sleep without them tearing across house chasing their toys there were toys each cats had favorite one there was good variety style catnip stuffed string one cats was super big on treats so may switch over treat less since toys were bigger hit overall seems worth with how much cats liked toys one gobbled up both treats \n cats absolutely lose when their meowbox comes in was shocked because ve tried toys before they weren t interested this comes in they are all over \n makers meow cat really know what cats like \n kitties loved this all handmade items were pleasant surprise along with cat nip \n like but wish there was more inside \n had so much fun watching kitty investigate her meow she loved toys most treats ca wait next one \n variety toys tissue also popular \n cat loved this he is obsessed with every single toy they are all so cute he also loves th treats if could give this star rating totally would they hand wrote his name on included birthday toy he was only born like weeks ago toys are so cute so fun he loves itself whole concept is absolutely adorable highly recommend \n definitely worth money kitties loved \n love this can tell who packs really loves cats \n every cat has their own personality this rings true especially with own cats contents tend be batting toys some treats had two boxes each time treats where not interesting cats had treats each time in cats do not like but they did enjoy other treat that was in last as toys they occasionally play with batting toys on their own but most frequently they get playful with toy that is moving one real fault this product is there are no feather toys or any shoestring toys that can use can play with cat get them interested in play br br that is not say product is bad because great right personalities is blessing have so give stars spite own personal experience is little less appealing me because think wonderful try at least once think there are plenty cats out there that will enjoy treats that come in here toys that they can bat around on their own again me throw one these toys across floor cat will run stop once no longer moves \n have been getting this cat few months now she has loved everything she has received thank you choosing such an awesome array toys treats \n cat went nuts when opened could even get tags off toys cat nip is super br high quality things you do see in br cat says \n cats love there where perfect think pics video show slef worth money cat toy cats treats are more expensive than dogs you ca just go any store get them on sale just little tiny little mouse is like three dollars in this drink with stick with toys hanging off they like apiece \n well so far im happy with subscription had cute theme good toys new treat thanks meowbox \n cat aroara was so surprised excited get this package she usually only gets presents on christmas her birthday she loved smell cat nap she acted like kitten \n good quality toys value money is also very good kittens younger cats would go crazy with most if not all these toys some are safer no parts rip off swallow more sturdy can last cat play than others \n all three our cats loved everything in our first was so impressed with quality toys neat packaging our even said hi kitties on inside flap m so excited see what arrives next month thank you meowbox \n"}

experiments with daughter she was so excited about following instructions that are very easily presented both in book in app seeing results we ca wait our highly recommend \n if you are looking something your child or maybe gift another child this is by far great purchase in today world we need keep our kids engaged in good things science is one best your child will see things that will

school have an idea cool career br br great job mel science \n set first two experiments are simple but great catch kid attention daughter was excited engaged then she continued playing in lab \n experiments are great way inspire kids about chemistry both boys daughter enjoyed them you get all that you need gloves measuring caps incredible value \n outstanding experience kids november had two experiments december has just arrived way is set up is that first shipment has starter kit commonly used tools first actual subscription items make experiments while second assume further boxes only have next br br our first had volcano carbon snake experiments both very easy do very impressive setup is great there is companion app you run on phone which tells you what do there is even small set phone so you do need hold while experimenting another nice thing is that they sent more materials than needed single try experiment so you can actually repeat extra br br highly recommended \n s awesome br elephant toothpaste experiment is just best chemistry we ve ever br kids are absolutely br waiting next parcel with day marked in our family kitchen br thank you guys \n year old loves his kit these kits are little more sophisticated than other kits we have used he is excited try new experiment each month he is able follow directions on his own was very happy with fast customer service response they replaced glass flask after son broke his \n really fun easy follow experiment instructions great activity whole house \n daughter loved following instructions seeing experiments work then exploring molecular structures in vr glasses science behind experiments is explained in fun visual way depending on age interest level kids can go more or less deep into learned something new too \n year old daughter loves both experiments lessons she learning chemistry enjoying herself too product is high quality bit pricey but you get what you paid \n son is was quite excited receive this in mail have come addressed him he loves getting mail see if arrived we only received first kit but enjoyed two experiments came with kit provided everything he needed experiment an extra pair gloves glasses which is nice if his brother ever wants join in on fun during this social distancing time nice give him something look forward highly recommend \n this was an excellent kit son especially appreciated that was real materials work with not kids science kit grab some table salt soap experiments he did go through extremely quickly so we wished there were even more extension ideas in kit but overall was great experience he also loved vr models though think that part might have been bit above his level \n extremely easy fun at same time \n got this granddaughter she really likes her favorite experiment was making virus she is looking forward shary info with her science teacher \n love monthly set we purchase on br there is enough do each project more than once there are about different experiments br year old looks forward them they do t take much time at all do maybe br includes everything you need pamphlet explaining entire chemical process that you are br br wish there was an option purchase case store all peter dishes glass beakers \n kids love already asking what s coming next m bit worry if son will find some interesting combination chemicals assume s good thing

expensive but all dog chews are \n dogs loved all variety treats sent looking forward next shipment \n labrador s loved treats in this they are hard on treats toys they blast through them pretty quickly \n is great have sampler treats that let dog try this is much better than standing wondering in overpriced pet aisle what chew treats will dog love now know she likes all items in first but her favorite is bully sticks can order just those as dog wait her next chew treats arrive this is perfect as dog is pup going through that first year chewing with these treats there is no destruction things around house she is kept busy enjoying chew treats \n dog loved treats although he is heavy chewer ended up eating treats extremely quickly so this unfortunately only lasted about week \n wish there was little more value money but dogs do love these chew treats one dogs is rather finicy he still eats these without stopping one give them him just wish that they provided little more content money \n have two big dogs came with enough both so far they love everything \n bought this golden retriever hopefully cheer her up she has loved all treats \n always includes different items that are appropriate size dog loves treats reasonable price too \n love that there is nothing from china or anything that is rawhide what you get think pricing was good at intro rate but bit out range normal monthly fee but peace mind knowing that is all natural dogs loved everything in would be well worth if could stretch budget just bit \n our pup gets so excited when his pawstruck arrives always good treats chews \n do understand hate about product being produced in states were company gets ingredients from is just simply based in cali we have two lb dogs they love these this is going on year two that we have been getting these boxes probably wo ever change think we have tried or different brand subscriptions pawstruck is absolute best \n god loves these \n videoid liked everything you made dog so happy \n contained nice variety chews only issue is that wish there were an option choose or opt out certain items \n buy pawstruck jerky every month as grizzly wolf gsd regular treat like this company so thought give this subscription try his first was good but do think value is there future boxes got deal on his first he went through largest chew so fast barely saw him chew still was good deal on one but be canceling his subscription \n this was good bundle different things all bloating some even gave girl more than minutes activity that saying something \n perfect dog he knows what ca open on very rare occasion there an item that might small him we absolutely loved our boxes \n dogs favorite chews keeps calm \n really debated getting subscription pawstruck large breeds because cost but decided give try have two large dogs signed up one per month because they do need that many large treats has worked very well victor maggie have loved every treat they have sent maggie can be picky we have received or boxes do br think we gotten same thing twice most treats are huge tend last longer than other natural treats some up minutes very aggressive chewer they put card in each with names pics descriptions what in only downside is that individual bags are labeled so those us who ca keep cards handy you do know what in most bags \n is always hit wish would show up in amazon subscriptions think just duplicated subscription because did see \n lb pit found hiding under car was gon na keep her but she saved damned cat that was months ago while do give daily she gets wide variety convenience is great variety is nice brother has lab pug mix able treat them with some br br might add an order cat more bigger treats later neighborhood dogs on our walks but these are good value \n appreciate contents but ended being too much dog have these regularly did alternate items she loved all them but just too much her system she little older so thought these would slow her down help keep her teeth clean but she ate several quite fast suspect that what did work her system get this again if had younger dog be open learning type \n bully sticks esophagus twists was good deal problem is nothing was labeled there was one package that am pretty sure was rawhide which is cheap controversial chew also would prefer more subscription options having skip each month instead having chance order bi monthly or quarterly would be more practical \n received pawstruck chew puppy loved all his chew bones treats lasted long time he was very excited get his surprise gave him lots joy comfort his chew time some his chew bones were smokey scented very happy puppy approved \n two eng springer spaniels enjoyed long paw sticks but they were gone in br br stretching these special treats out rewards still using harder chews busy activities \n"}

that are in style colors that are also \n love this bag nice quality products organic lip balms lip scrubs lipliners with colors would actually wear \n nice colors might not have tried on own \n really liked products wish lipstick was little darker winter \n so far love \n nice colors full size items \n was very pleasantly suprised with selection lip products was happy with every single

family \n love this subscription you can try lot different brands colors \n must try discovered numerous brands with great products through this \n really liked playing with lipstick lip gloss that recieved colors were perfect me you could beat price \n purchased this myself because love try new lip products so far have liked all products can see that maybe some colors may not go with everyone s skin tone but that s ok s fun anyway \n have had chance use all products yet but ones have are well liked not sure why there was lip liner sent in color that does match any other products sent though delivery was decently quick price is great number products sent \n love layered lipsticks color was not favorite but when applied lipstick really liked had fun layering lipstick was new me \n like packaging was surprised at pick colors very pleased \n great buy good products wish came with better type bag hold but good overall \n great variety things was so happy see colors could use excited see what next \n got this try some new products as m not most makeup savvy person was fun get really nice that colors were fairly normal ve had other boxes that have come with electric purple or other obnoxious colors d never wear love chapstick that came was light didn t feel like had anything on lips at all no residue happy with everything else as well \n subscribed on october but have only received so far liked but am still waiting more \n this lip monthly subscription is nice first month did receive items valued higher that subscription service think around worth product they weren t products that would have paid full price but don t expect magic happen every time with service like this only little time will tell if will really be worth \n nice choices good colors some variety however lip pencil which do normally use anyway gave try but was either little dry or just did glide on well had toss \n item was as described with super fast shipping \n got super pretty classic red lipstick that stuck with me all night lip pencil that doubles as blush that makes really clean lines cute gloss that was super slick shiny more matte person myself but lipstick gloss were actually both something would wear again \n had these delivered now like them probably wo use all seem get mostly nude colors but that what use most daytime anyway so pleased \n bought this myself enjoyed tote they came with course all lip shades they thinking winter with darker shades just wish not so much red more pink thankyou \n actually like lip monthly you can never get enough makeup is what say does have brands have heard or tried yet so nice have options luckily they usually only have lip gloss in bag which could do without willing trade on ig \n edit be honest say was wrong found this again while cleaning these are pretty nice everything that came were all coordinating colors all decent quality not amazing but equal drugstore do like lip liner that came but rest went on smoother then remembered still agree that this might be better casual at makeup rather br br previous review below br well as grown woman this was pretty much waste money edit ignore me haha all but one product felt like barely better then dollar store quality one that did was useful me at all being super glossy slightly colored gloss that being said would have loved this in like grade this feels like would be fantastic gift middle early high schoolers who are into make up \n love this just recently signed up subscription got first one in couple days ago saw that in future subscriptions that said they don t know will be back in stock really hoping is not going away \n sometimes there are some questionable items but luckily have two teen girls that will take what do not like will use themselves girls love variety have noticed have gotten same products couple months in row does bother me but might bother someone else who does have any girls give their products too overall do enjoy lip monthly \n would like mention that was existant subscribe but this is first delivery happy with received makeup item super cheap bag that an not be considered cosmetic bag but get good items that will work me just hate orange liner but well you ca control what are you going get whenever you subscribe this kind stuff two items cost around third one super good first month just saw bad reviews but decide try will update next month would see if good stuff still arriving please be real when you subscribe you ca control what are you going get check values you will get lucky if you get colors that you use all

collapsible straw with carrying case small plush pusheen cute vinyl pusheen scene she was so excited about all items will definitely be buying her more so happy that feel like m actually getting good deal \n we just got our first super cute however daughter is just little disappointed because after halloween everything except items are halloween themed also she got hoodie in medium but more like extra large so she wo be able wear anywhere but home but also halloween themed halloween was last week so br think we are going skip next which will be shipped in january believe just because we do want get holiday items after holiday holiday themed things are fun use shortly before during holiday not after in opinion br otherwise items are cute was worth cost \n have been receiving pusheen subscription since they started have always found something or two or three or all in like or love items that are not really thing always find someone who would enjoy them had another cat themed subscription cancelled after first one because was so disappointed not with this one great cat lover in your life or you \n mystery arrived few days late was little worried after reading some negative reviews however arrived today was such an amazing pleasure every item was delightful pleasing good quality soo adorable items were good quality love each one them will definitely continue subscription more than that highly recommend everyone will provide another update once next arrives on schedule in few months \n subscribed this mystery pusheen as special surprise daughter she loved over moon loved quantity darling items within as well as excellent quality everything makes this truly great gift definitely exceeded expectations \n subscribed pusheen over year loved almost every item received still use many items mug shower curtain blanket pillow cases mini fan you name quality varies some are made rather inexpensive material from china that have that weird cheap factory smell makes me worry if all materials used are but design is often irresistible only reason stopped was because everything in house was being taken over by pusheen drove spouse crazy but if you love pusheen anything involving cat you find nirvana with this \n have subscribed pusheen couple years now wife loves pusheen every month is new fun surprise her before you purchase you have understand not every is an all these subscription mystery boxes are little bit uneven some boxes are ok that all cool then there are some like fall that just arrived that absolutely knock socks off recipient fall was best br br will say that fall winter boxes seem be best think that is partially because nature season in fall winter you tend get something warm fuzzy like hoodie or blanket etc spring summer boxes are always good too but think about they ca exactly send you pusheen bikini sizing that general public would be impossible so spring summer tend be more display br br every month get see wife light up like kid again with fun little trinkets clothes blankets shoes you name hope they keep going with this years come \n products were all wonderful br came alittle bit dents messed up parts br shirt we got was medium looks like large or xlarge so maybe order size down but very satisfied with purchase we will buy again \n after waiting several weeks guess she s used amazon prime daughter was beyond

bought this husband as christmas present class as something fun us do as couple am so glad did we really liked scenario couldn t wait our next evidence files etc so much so that we couldn t wait monthly had them shipped early every time we finished would definitely recommend subscription we are looking forward checking out another subscription \n month season is fun but bit pricey did realize that once you find killer subscription continues but is indeed clearly marked in description or at least now is missed when ordering initially is fun family game night but did cancel once realized was getting season two boxes in case you wondering they ca be returned as per mildred from hunt killer customer br br each investigation unfolds over season you ll eliminate one suspect every month until thrilling conclusion once you find killer your subscription continues with brand new story br br have fun hunting \n great game extremely great customer service they are most helpful game is very well made very authentic \n so far really like product came right on time have no complaints yet \n have been trying draw wife away from tv our phones in evening when kids go sleep wife is crazy about murder mystery shows like serial podcast making murderer on netflix so this is right up her br br has become fun way us bond work together through clues we find ourselves texting about case in middle br br writing is really believable clues are actual high quality items that you can use in real world once you eliminate suspects in latest likely order series which is more speed \n husband are working our first case we completed first episodes although usual process is receive one per month you can ask them send you next episode early we received our next one within days request we enjoy so much that we bought premium case that can be solved in one night new year eve party while some may consider monthly subscription price expensive you could spend more going out on friday night see movie more interactive fun \n am obsessed amount work that they put into creating these cases gathering evidence fun stuff they send you in is well worth people complaining about price should really sit down realize work that they put into this you can get your earlier you just have email them this time got two off gift cards give friends their first which is really awesome first is little slow but when second rolls around really gets things going plus you can buy off their website same price little bit easier manage your stuff with them \n really enjoyed hak subscribed then cancelled after reading reviews should have waited until after recieved judged myself this game is obviously not everyone bought this daughter do our game night is really fun made me feel like real detective unfortunately have start over resubscribe but do even care will be worth me so in honest opinion love hak \n wow just finished first hunt killer we had so much fun not sure can wait another month next interactive engaging can tell they put lot thought in creating story characters highly recommend did first with group friends neighbor we were all blown away \n pretty awesome game thrill seeking detective type like myself its bit difficult thats what enjoy most about game cost is bit high subscription is must if you want finish entire course find that as downside this but its super fun would recommend \n this game is lot fun our kids love playing detective really get into each has high quality materials online component is done very br br don t subscribe through amazon amazon subscription service is horribly broken every time you ship an order different address or person through your account amazon subscription software automatically thinks that this is new subscription will start sending you again or maybe different previous as result we spent lot time many emails with hunt killer customer service having them send us correct boxes now we have three episode two episode etc br br do yourself poor customer service people favor just subscribe through hunt killer site directly amazon knows about their subscription issues but is not able fix \n just finished first better than even expected love mfm crime junkies ect heard about on podcast few months ago stuff that is included in is super realistic which makes really believable they get all suspects have you do things that detective would like go through interviews see if suspects have an alibi make timeline events look inconsistencies find secret clues in br br really cool looking forward next \n"}

this love japanese snacks because they re so much lighter also love pamphlet that comes in because helps explain what everything is \n japanese snacks are br did expect taste so good makes me want be in japan \n liked all snacks in two boxes that received me novelty trying snacks from japan is so far making this worth but does feel on expensive side amount treats you getting in \n great try variety japanese snacks while there are some snacks in that did not like overall liked with variety there are bound be or snacks that you just do not like taste card that explains what snacks are in help figure out what snacks are if you can not read japanese arrived in reasonable amount time \n everything was beautiful so far very tasty \n loved all snacks book that shows where they come from \n was interesting try but not worth money \n awesome with good variety \n loved welcome was absolutely packed full awesome unique snacks that never would have had if was getting this \n liked snacks so much ordered second subscription \n had just four snacks was hooked loved that was given info about all them where they are from in japan along with that got very friendly welcome as new member thank you look forward next \n like being able read about various treats that little bit regional history that is in booklet provided in with treats \n had little dent when arrived aside from that all snacks were there they were good they are great introduction japan even though is expensive one glad bought \n great collection snacks one was little crushed but we enjoyed regardless long way travel from japan \n tasting snacks from where she was born is very exciting experience sometimes she does br we had other boxes from japan but this one seems be br recommended \n adult daughter loves she wants go japan so this is just lil taste presentation was amazing snacks tasty \n this is absolutely delightful delicious is palate opening trip through japan there was one thing that did taste good very satisfied with boksu their products \n so much better than snacks can get at japanese supermarket great variety \n so many yummy treats we really love trying out new kinds snacks chocolates s so much fun there are so many snacks in this that husband actually need several days try them all br like how most snacks there is two or even more portions so makes perfect share with hubby \n think this product is amazing is good quality worth money snacks are always diverse with there own flavor s always surprise s also great because s not same thing every time comes with something different every time spice things up snacks always have great flavor think best part in opinion are fruit gummies or tea that usually come with mochi is one favorite things when comes snacks so that has be one best things that come with think that this product is you should give try you get what you pay honestly with how much you pay this is definitely worth \n love all snacks inside this they are all unique taste each them is unrepeatable exclusive that why they are so precious you do have snacks like that in usa some people are pointing on asian groceries stores or markets perhaps they do have some snacks there as well but they ca be similar what is in this they are handmade snacks makes them be even more special like open dig in by looking leftovers feels sad let all snacks go when they are all eaten in very short period time look forward receive another booklet with information about japan is great addition love love love japan very special interesting country thank you all your hard work \n this was given me as gift love is really nice came me packed with snacks tea book that is sent with breaks down everything in shares lot information also love that has theme teaches you about japan geography language etc they also say this is authentic believe shipped directly me from japan shared treats with others we all sipped tea read booklet was honestly really fun experience look forward doing again \n very fun see all different kinds snacks in was somewhat leery subscribing at first because live near asian markets but what was in is different from what was able get at area speciality stores also information sheet is informative fun \n tastes great like both snacks information booklet \n great really enjoyed each item from different places in japan can not wait receiving next \n gave this sister who is intrigued by japanese culture she loved so much we both ate reviewed snacks together overall had great time recommend this if you want high quality delicious snacks are interested in japan foods worth money \n we have really enjoyed variety in every light crunchy puffy items are especially tasty booklet describing everything is informative love that takes me in tour japan \n yummy in tummy \n enjoyed this but think would be lot better if they labeled things like trying new things but there are times want savory not sweet or but this is fun although quite pricey \n"}

share two br br had subscription with them couple years ago was impressed with kit picky brat so that says br br now you do have take in consideration that possible that you wo love every single craft that what you expecting do think surprise craft is you you can always find something online you want make go get supplies yourself that has nothing do with this subscription though should take away from positive review liked not knowing what id get knowing would have everything needed make craft could gift people who would like ans enjoy craft made by br br even if you did get everything you wanted is really fair leave complaining review point is enjoy crafting convenience think \n really like getting new craft make each month instructions are clear with pictures have been able fill house with own custom artwork have discovered new hobbies never knew would enjoy recommend this anyone who is creative enjoys working with their hands \n ve subscribed about months love this every single is something different with clear instructions literally everything you need including many most basic supplies ve tried loved crafts skills never would have had courage try on own \n was gift think was fine \n fun crafts adults have received two so far really enjoyed both worth money \n got first craft everything you could possibly need is included am not giving away any clues because whole idea is get surprise craft project right loved first one fun easy complete sad part is have wait until next month receive next one \n loved first kit will say materials were worth money spent no but will say paid an experience in that experience don t have drive closest craft store find all products need don t have think what craft want do how do have step step instructions on how do project guess what now have heat tool embossing powder which would have never gotten if weren t this am not creative enough come up with own crafts so love that they take all guess work out you also tell you how do m experience was worth money \n think what is most important is have easy follow directions examples first kit received had nice easy follow examples suggestions am looking forward next project am doing this try new things would probably not attempt on own this seems be perfect \n adults crafts is fantastic product truly enjoyed how easy was get into creative spirit with wood burning kit used as meaningful gift special person they loved these kits are great way stay in tune with your diy side at great price m really happy with this kit \n have started doing project yet but from looks can already tell alot better then other art subscription you can get other one did seen worth money spent on but this one has alot more ca wait try out \n had great time with this craft shared tiles with niece ran out white fault so had improvise with pattern not perfectly perfect but that s ok thinking need put clear layer over top seal \n got first kit was exactly craft would picked myself but that is going happen looking forward seeing what else comes they do send just about everything you need was on vacation they only thing needed was scissors keep pair medical shears in car so we made work had fun with friend was worth experience \n received first kit today is as promised everything need complete is in kit including objects this kit is designed little pricey what is already have necessary br br however flip side coin is that all prep work has been done me cute project not saying what spoilers in this review that could have pulled together myself but that would entail going hardware store part going craft store rest then at very least would need get out pencil tape measure an awl circular saw phew after that would be tired working on project before even had chance assemble have very short attention span br br so pricey goes into making easy me make this project do look forward upcoming kits now would be nice company have survey find out what buyer would be interested in learning as well as those crafts that would totally put buyer off \n am updating previous review this has enough items couple work on together was fun enjoyable agree with other reviewers that if kit came in that could be used store tools after would be star but that oversight knocks off star \n some things keep myself some gift some create with kids grandkids sometimes there are missing items humans pack boxes after all they are always helpful quick respond correct mistakes some crafts don t work so great me fault not theirs some crafts are not me so gift craft like said

they would have them spread throughout house one cat loves month later is still climbing into napping despite her being too big spilling over br do really need receive monthly supply cat toys cats are pretty good at not destroying them but was glad have some fresh ones with this \n youngest took all toys out she did not want share with other played with them until she needed nap we will get at least one more delivery \n he still plays with all this new toys month later ca wait second arrive \n first was great \n was impressed with quality toys especially price so was cat she immediately stole cat nip toy took over crinkle mat lol looking forward see next theme have not tried other boxes its first but sticking with \n update red cardinal they got in one had be thrown away was loved bit too much by all kitties cats on left in tatters hope we get another one haha br br get dietary so get one more toy instead treats we have cats which two have food allergies one our kitties was with me when we got last sat on floor with him he was so excited he was nuzzling playing toys while was trying detach them from cards he loved everything in then rolled in one other kitties has been playing with he likes nudge open upside down get under considered cancelling but they get so excited over whoever happens be near when open that wo all four have been enjoying toys they still play

everything in went wild with throwing up in air tossing about great see her playing br br most toy choices simply were working kitties their one favorite mouse product was discontinued by manufacturer few years ago extras bought are slowly dying they had no interest in toys was getting them except glitter ball so tried kitnip see if they could improve on what was buying has been pretty successful get without treats so they get an extra toy so far out boxes only toys were not played with those went sister who has much younger br br here thing not going work all cats if your cat tears toys apart your cat will tear these apart as well they are well made toys but they are not indestructible some cats like big toys some prefer teeny tiny toys was actually surprised mama was playing with safari vest as she is normally exclusively tiny toy cat pricewise not bad average toy at petsmart is so toys is pretty reasonable especially since they are playing with most them each includes toy you encourage them movement although one that hung on door was no interest older cats \n cats love these boxes usually ca even get shoes off day they get delivered because cats will be trying get into before open \n cats were very excited they checked everything out did not want miss anything buddy sophie are older cats but loved all goodies \n what wonderful item purchased one dietary restrictions

\n quick shipping first month was good selection \n record is skipping \n so far so good just got first shipment got london calling clash love this \n so far have had all good albums sent me \n still early in subscription yet so far so good \n great reissue classic album \n think this is good idea fair price but really like some advanced notification each month selection in case already have lp in collection or something do care have \n am only couple months in but so far am very impressed with selections albums probably would not have picked myself but have loved each one \n record comes right after ordered was very good deal double album price was well known album great deal however didn t need this album so return was really easy only bad thing is you immediately get an email telling you what album is in case you would like be surprised when arrives am excited see what next vinyl is will definitely continue with this subscription \n thought this was double albums first one was clash was second was black sabbath single album already owned interested in seeing what will be was expecting classic rock roll \n first title wall was awesome \n like concept but am definitely in favor choices each month have default album that will ship but have alternatives in case we already own that album or do like that performer seems fairly simple implement should result in more album sales each month amazon \n everything has been good with subscription so far had one issue with packaging an album not looking good wrote review twice first one they would use so rewrote so we see have got who ccr so far they have been great both album sets \n have large collection vinyl was pleasantly surprised \n purchased this monthly deal as christmas gift myself man if this is what like be gift that keeps on giving \n purchased this monthly deal as christmas gift myself man if this is what like be gift that keeps on giving \n just signed up not disappointed first vinyl was clash london calling s must own album we are just loving can t wait see what next months is \n decided give vinyl month shot music era they targeted has lot artists like this club is very similar as columbia house bmg first month received clash album london calling this is great because is an awesome album that did have know some people received wall by pink floyd which would have been awesome but am not disappointed right now this is four stars hopefully there will not be hassle if have return an album possibly an artist am not fan or already have but have never had an issue with amazon in past do agree with some people amazon should send you an email month ask if you would like album you either reply yes or no that simple give us certain time period say yes or no they would save on shipping returns \n london calling by clash was received last month was pleased see that was pressing from eu that sells on amazon at about twice cost monthly br br this month s exile on main street m certainly happy sooner or later they re gon na pick selection which already have recent pressing but not so far copy exile dates from time br br update since providing this review have received enjoyed several vinyl classics not already in collection such as wall are you experienced who sell out see that this month selection coming me is quadrophenia also by who see that will be soundtrack edition not original release album so not what would consider be classic vinyl edition good have but just not same \n received dark side moon by pink floyd which is one favorites ca wait see what get next month \n you can see what is when tracks cancel or return unopened no problem \n first lp was exile on main street great value looking forward next \n great value great value \n love subscription but when skipped month because already owned title being delivered me was sent next month have figured out how inform amazon that already have title do wish receive duplicate that would like next selection instead \n like christmas once month \n this is great keep what you want cancel what you don t love rolling stones pink floyd not fan who so canceled those ones really like this club as you will get albums you don t necessarily think about have beggers banquet by stones on way normally \n enjoyed pick this month was classic album credence clearwater revival is great band home run if you want know opinion \n just signed up today so would have missed june selection but first title is neither wall nor london calling diana ross supremes import from music on vinyl again this is selection that would cost more buy directly so first month this is good deal since so early in game we do have any idea how they are doing selection process whether one person title will eventually circle around others later on example in later months will get titles that others have gotten already wall london calling exile on main street did see explicitly stated in but if they are offering free shipping return selection that you do want then this really is overall \n this first album was received as expected in great condition double record was pleasant surprise looking forward listening some favorite tunes from past \n first choice vinyl month clash london calling great album by band that was expanding their horizons beyond limitations single genre \n"}

first shipment daughter yo was not impressed \n bought these niece she loved only planned on month subscription but she loved so much her grandma took up subscription \n eight year old daughter absolutely devoured this was so much fun there are so many pieces she got passport stickers her stamps as she goes each country then we went about solving mystery she just thought was so exciting there were only couple puzzles she didn t enjoy or understand very well out approximately fifteen came with neither us were in love with book about egypt came with was little too hard dry facts m hoping other books other countries are done little more creatively but rest crossing off who did going through puzzle pages hunting down clues was just so much fun highly recommend \n year old spent almost full day working his way through his first could not recommend more \n kids called me last night after they received first granddaughter was very excited she talked out huge map have not seen product myself however daughter was impressed \n loved but renewal price is little high m sad that have cancel subscription \n loved kiddo loved going through puzzle book looking answers helps with knowledge highlighted area we ended up doing some together as family which was fun \n daughter loves these kits actually have tell her take break or she be done in few days \n this is fun way teach children about different countries activities keep you engaged there is some problem solving required plus mysteries require that you go back country guidebook read specific br all this will help your child improve his or her informational reading your child will learn fun interesting facts about country will improve thinking skills along way when you figure out who did where did person do what object was involved there is real sense accomplishment highly recommend this \n daughter loves this was concerned because highlights eludes younger ages she was occupied days straight figuring out multiple mysteries in order solve full crime similar clue where you determine who what where how made her work think but she also enjoyed lot we are both looking forward next first is not sample is full size mystery ready br continuing subscription as christmas gift \n love product concept ordered year old nephew christmas gift there was no opportunity put gift message in \n year old loves these he gets super excited when they arrive in mail he loves feeling like mysteries are cute husband does feel that they are little formulaic repetative but year old still loves love that son learns bit about places around world while on an imaginary adventure they are fantastic educational tools corona kids parents we can imagine we been somewhere else \n"}

working from home this was beyond perfect chews were good quality there were some that could be eaten quickly others like bones hooves that are keeping them happy little longer love that this comes from small us company have been recommending this all dog friends \n pups were so excited receive their first gnawbox when we opened there was lot variety in there were about chews in pups get so excited try new one each day \n while dogs do like different items first was priced at introduction rate next will be not sure if what rec in is worth if continue with barkbox would have stop some other treats have on br subscription need decide but as said dogs loved some pieces are long but very thin feel like they are put there as filler do like that \n have three german shepherds ve subscribed large gnaw several months now dogs love treats they are all appropriate larger sized dogs each contains different variety treats none them lasts very long such strong chewers but dogs enjoy them few minutes at least occasionally there are treats that take them longer chew ve been satisfied with quality products have felt safe giving them dogs ears tracheas bully sticks rings have all been large enough dogs that didn t worry about them just swallowing them without chewing first \n best chews around clean not stinky dog loves them bits literally \n dogs loved them however don t know if s worth cost how little is in \n great selection all natural pets loved some wish there was more product that cost \n so agree with other reviewers that first was underwhelming contacted them about concerns even had few suggestions they were very responsive second arrived last week saved weekend as we were having winter storm was very pleased with second there was card explaining what contained had nice variety treats like boxes because they have things wouldn t have considered purchasing that pups absolutely love \n we have now had our second delivery first was packed with great things our dogs chew on second wasnt nearly as full but still had lot quality chews still bargain nothing smelled artificial or like they had been sprayed with something our dogs really enjoyed them we will see what brings \n this is our second we are beyond happy this one is even better then first huge variety mastiff puppy could be happier hoofs are by far his favorite he chews while then tosses them around plays with them they have lasted almost week now is packed with lots other treats we ca wait next month \n we just got our first our dog scarlette loved them all so much she would stop begging more safe say less than week later she has eaten all treats comes with great variety your dogs try all their products \n liked quality product that is sourced in usa however was bit pricey snack lover he is very productive chewer goes through these way too fast needed get him really tough toys that can put treats in so takes him awhile extract them \n has good amount treats in they are probably worth price paid however dog doesn t seem interested in eating them normally get him large bones rawhides but thought this may be better bow sent is cute but probably won t use on male dog seeing that s pink overall good quality quantity just have picky dog \n was little nervous given some reviews but we received large bag filled with several different types chews that our dog loved packaging looked really nice looks like they listened reviews that were concerned with this included key chain light we got several ears both long short jerky sticks our dog loved ears but chewed through jerky in minute overall was great value promotional price but at full price does keep our dog entertained long enough be worth us \n dog likes these some actually last longer than most happened have half price deal but full price would be too pricey means \n purchased these dogs when subscription was off figured would cancel after first month anyhow dogs enjoyed treats so much that husband guilted me into not cancelling subscription they are beyond happy every time new arrives \n lots variety good size number \n our dog loved this goodies we will continue subscription when out budget allows \n pit

next theme is am big fan so will definitely stay subscribed that excited july receive next \n collectors was awesome ca wait future boxes arrive \n love this first you receive pops most mystery boxes only give if any pops love marvel universe so many different characters you ll always get something different \n ever since they made black boxes smaller actual funko pops are usually damaged so if you are collecting funko pops be prepared have all them damaged captain america was crushed \n love this phoenix was little bit dented tho but don t mind \n really like captain marvel think amount value things inside are worth what we pay be honest did like past boxes that much but hope you keep this kind br thank you \n love pop stylized shirts im new collecting this is going help me add collection recommend people who love funko marvel \n love love gold option \n absolutely love \n got husband he loves getting boxes filled with funko pop other memorabilia \n great bundle any deadpool

were all snacks that have not seen at local grocer so is fun branch out eat more than just granola bars if this is in your budget is yummy treat \n used other snack subscription boxes in past but this has been favorite have yet had any duds in so actually love serendipity that comes from having wide variety interesting delicious snacks show up in each \n like trying different items in small amounts \n saw some negative reviews was little worried about subscribing but wow am impressed definitely worth money got first haven t tried single product that s disappointed m always on hunt healthy snacks that don t taste like salty cardboard so this is perfect me good many negative comments were about snacks all being health conscious snacks but s says that in description sooooo anyways you should give try get less snacks if you re iffy but think you ll be pleasantly surprised \n ike concept think s nice way be introduced different snacks but was disappointed with size bags snack portions were smaller than expected however they were all delicious \n this was real fun had things we knew we d like things we had never tried before recommend \n"}

far they were delicious favorite this bunch is sweet heat brewed pot was so delicious perfectly balanced went right their website ordered more also really love little extras included in subscription little tin is cute is perfect store package tea even though packages tea comes in are resealable also love paper pouches used them when just want make one cup tea they work really well highly recommend company their teas \n loved this treasure tea small tea caddy tea filters beautifully presented made day get made day taste first cup rooibus tea ca wait get another installment \n got second this month can so far say that have been very surprised mostly happy with selection while may not have been fan one flavor have received so far that is just personal preference quality has been outstanding thus far really like variety that have received if there was downside would say that is if you wanted get larger supply particular tea may not be available but as an addition your regular loose leaf this is nice foray into unexpected interesting \n they sent such great variety teas always excellent quality easy instructions nice resealable pouches etc ca say enough good things so sorry they quit doing their monthly \n we just got our first first tea we tried was black tea earl de creme had mine plain while daughter had milk in hers we both enjoyed very much was exceptionally smooth ca wait try other flavors \n every contains some oolong darjeeling pu erh which are not black teas that said they are tea types like really loved pistachio pu erh so not complaining could do without decaf option \n would really emphasize that this packages provides delicious high quality teas but not necessarily large quantity personally think variety plus quality is worth price in received four different teas all quite delicious flavorful tea in each packet will provide three first seeps so if you seep your tea only once you will get about twelve cups but all teas received were good enough seep at least one more time so got about cups tea out packets received if you only seep your tea once you may not feel like you are getting your money worth you wo get full value out br also get good flavor you will need follow instructions not over seep or use too hot water found that when set timer paid attention instructions tea was really good one cup let seep too long killed br have only received one so far had an assam tea floral tea spicy tea chocolate tea they covered four different flavors which was nice variety favorite was black tea melted chocolate also really enjoyed organic tea blackened heart had nice hints rose was very smooth goes bitter if seeped too long mexican hot chocolate is okay but very strong am ending up with extra cups because using smaller amount tea per cup also having experiment with adding extra sugar or cream really enjoy \n they had best teas around was getting three different boxes month from them when they announced they were going out business bought in teas miss surprises every month tried other companies but their teas simply are as good field cup introduced me teas never would have found especially very traditional regional teas husband was thrilled find some very rare teas he had never found outside his home contry india we bought all we could those ones before they were gone our closet is now filled huge cardboard boxes teas but always feel sad when bag runs out becuase wont be having any more that kind \n good way try different types black teas refreshing be giant pot sip through \n first came ten days earlier than expected with loose leaf tea container not really needed since bags are resealable paper teabags rather than having hunt down mesh infuser loose leaf tea mug is at work was able go straight sipping br not really mentioned on amazon but if you want more particular tea they sell them individually on their site as well conveniently listed by month subscription level so takes all ten seconds locate what

variety was nice one large bag one small bag one beef stick all very different flavors textures m looking forward next shipment \n delicious variety no misses all solid flavors \n been subscribed three or four months now always nice surprise at beginning month really shocked at how many people are complaining about price given that only if you content just eat black pepper or teriyaki flavored beef jerky you can go get some at gas station by paying little bit more you get unique flavors you helping support small businesses only once have felt like one products was lacking little bit in flavor but was still about on par with regular stuff you can buy anywhere all been beef so far but did get one that was pastrami so hoping see if maybe there little more variety meats with some future

product though couple snacks are small really enjoyed fig bars coconut cookies chips are good too as is trail mix \n this makes fun surprise every month really enjoy being able try new snacks without committing full size package other reviews say snacks are sample size but haven t had that issue like that they focus on finding healthy snacks because can feel good about sharing them with year old also their customer service is extremely responsive helpful friendly rare treat these days those saying s too remember that purchase each helps send food those in need too yes you could find individual items cheaper elsewhere but that would take time effort this has helped me discover snacks probably never would have found otherwise as busy mom consider slightly higher price convenience tax that am happy pay \n this is perfect love small sizes if given opportunity can eat whole bag chips or crackers but with this takes craving away after surprise treat after boxes have only had throw two things away because didn t like think that s pretty good \n everything was great well we could do without seaweed but our dog is enjoying looking forward next \n dont eat much during day while at

this go \n is packed with lots brands that are similar whole foods some were amazing others more unique but enjoyed figuring out which ones really loved which ones might pass on kind like trying new veggies as kid you have at least take bite or two before deciding even more popular brands like snyders were in which was perfect daughter who does always like healthier stuff say try or you wo actually know if you like \n variety deliciousness \n ok am forever searching new interesting in smallish town like live in big stores have pared down sellers likely provide that finding seller able pack whole lotta different into one has been real br snacks are well curated very high br best part found several new favorites including melatonin infused dark chocolate that actually helps me get sleep br obviously not everything can be favorite but quality manifest in choices is obvious br happy br three boxes in now br ok still happy customer still discovering new stuff track down br sharing with family friends has created more than few new favorites greater majority which are easily order able br healthier too \n very yummy although am afraid could eat entire thing in one sitting which would defeat purposes \n first tried lotus biscoff with coffee this morning was quite tasty really liked absorbed coffee very quickly melted in br banana bread bar was very soft expessally being gluten free br bada bean bada boom was an excellent low calorie snack br chefs cut beaf jurky was very soft tender would buy br funky chunky was best thing in im already thinking about buying br bare

this was pleasantly surprising as know some previous boxes were considered pretty deficient remember that reviews on this page are all boxes that have been issued by amazon see latest ones sort by most br br shirt looks very nicely printed high quality have worn yet but like exclusive chewbacca funko pop is good when considering value keep in mind that exclusive funkos such as convention

like subscription option \n was nice watch was little small wrist \n way see this is that s curated things that wouldn t usually buy example in spring received reily throw that is sold on seller website s very high quality felt great immediately became favorite throw wouldn t normally pay that much blanket other items in were nice have as summer sunglasses are very high quality they re sold on brand website haven t heard about that brand before but was really impressed by quality looked up their other models same contained retinol eye cream normally wouldn t pay that much an eye cream so s good chance try see if s worth waterproof packs are very useful keep credit card id cash when example going beach don t want carry br br opinions are divided on usefulness items totally agree didn t expect that not everything in is useful or needed at all but if goal is receive items that would usually buy on own then wouldn t subscribe just go buy what need \n just received second love this

order free online including shipping aftershave toner deodorant coppertone clear sunscreen full size boka toothbrush pretty activated charcoal bristles travel toothbrush protector marvis toothpaste

suscribe \n really liked this can t wait till get next \n me boyfriend are funko collectors we love this collector we have tried loot crates this is best one out there \n captain marvel end game boxes were amazing \n everybody is bashing these boxes because they were fans year anniversary contents but one loved movie moment was awesome was meant be star show will admit was as awesome as venom but was still worth money ca wait get \n should have joined this sooner only really wanted pop but other items in are actually pretty cool \n one pop came bent damaged disappointed as was gift \n great br would get more but do not need all same stuff \n love funko marvel boxes full stuff love everyone in family has subscription we love marvel we are getting new shelves our collection \n amazing collector two pop funkos were unique one glows br tshirt was soft fit great collectable glass cup was nice \n happy with some months are better but point these boxes is surprise special editions you can t get in store \n this was best theme have ever received ive been getting them last months love that we got pops they were both so well done is everything could want actually do mind coasters amazing job on this one hope next theme is just as cool \n we do ever get boxes like this but this was worth shot thought items were great was exactly what we expected great cost excited see what comes next presentation was certainly giftable too only issue which may affect comfort with continuing subscription is if receive more themed drinking glasses one is nice but do have room or need ten \n overall like items in captain marvel would buy again \n one best boxes funko has come up with all items were great only wish they still included patch pin \n started off with deadpool pop ride was fantastic taco holder is great keeping remotes in one spot just cute little trinkets can t wait what s next \n think this was perfect got pop toys glass drink from tshirt lovee \n super cool concept love value love funkos will definitely keep this subscription going \n venom was worth variety product really pays itself with pop shirt pint size hero sticker stress ball so much in just this marvel collector corps has always been great subscribe too \n cool graphics on with unique items you can get anywhere else well worth price you paying funko pops others are just extras \n fun stuff rare pop inside great condition \n alright so captain marvel very much worth you got not but exclusive pops cool pint glass was also included will be using bubbly drinks only complaint is with shirt size honestly do even mind all that much would give stars but was little too big \n this was best surprise am huge black widow fan loved all that was inside br such bargain can t wait july \n first got was infinity saga end credit loved cool pops nice shawarma size m fits great me one groot pin one thanos sticker \n shirt fits perfect size soft comfortable material design looks as pictured funkos are great especially one sticker is very nice pin was only issue one stars has blue spot covering most other than that pin is very nice is also great \n ordered captain marvel mostly really liked each item feel like pops could have been little more unique nick fury goose were definitely highlight shirt that comes in was amazing glass was also pretty awesome still great value was just really hoping carol danvers with leather hat \n item received great product satisfied \n"}
{"PID": "B07DX25MZK", "tokens": "came with decent amount good quality tea price ive tried all teas they all taste great \n delicious husband loved tea \n only drank so far was not chai tea drinler before but like variety offered \n overall have enjoyed teas there has only been one tea that didn t like only thing wish is on original there was one option month that is caffeine free like drink tea all day but can t drink caffeine late at night \n package tea came in was very well designed stylish was shipped in was shipper so there was no wasted material when you open tea is wrapped in one layer tissue paper all teas come in standard foil sealed packages with different brewing instructions on each pack \n thought knew what tea should taste like until tried tea runners genuinely thought all tea needed bit honey or drop milk taste balanced tea runners completely changed perspective on quality teas ll never go back \n went into this subscription with no knowledge in brewing own tea tea runners provide tasty selection each month made easy enough complete understand \n have had subscription since very beginning say am fan is putting mildly tea is delicious there is really good variety each month am never bored teas come from all over world each have distinct flavor started with original then moved all black now am enjoying pure tea am never br br have also reached out customer service several times they have always been prompt professional \n not great \n real people if you like tea at all this subscription is amazing each month they have really interesting variety blends each bag tells you how much use how long steep whether caffeine never tasted loser seriously been getting this or months now every time like christmas because know going love what they have know that is loose leaf tea so if you do already have one you want procure roomy tea ball hold tea while steeps in your mug been very glad subscribed this recommended others buy this tea \n always balanced variety with first rate customer service quality product \n loving selection want more consistent shipping schedule tea with some amazing flavors \n will say that not much tea connoisseur always kind liked tea but never knew much about recently received second but first one has been amazing thus far variety has kind kept me on toes they include information so you do scorch ruin tea leaves been nice learn as first few cups botched little due inexperience also live at very high altitude need keep that in mind as affects temperatures at which water br br as figured out how long heat up water each package tea been able taste notice lot more subtleties in each variety they all also been refreshing something else note is that packaging each tea is pretty good too can usually smell sealed items easily but ca really smell anything when these teas are still sealed \n loved these teas originally purchased only because special price subscription but think m going keep subscription flavors are great m very impressed \n best quality teas that ve ever come across they ve sent me teas ve never heard but am now addicted lol ie yunan yellow tea ve already got mom brother signed up their subscription boxes they are loving them just as much as am \n received first tea runners was pleasantly surprised start love portable zip lock you can take anywhere second each individual packet gives brewing instructions caffeine levels last but certainly not least is selection received different teas different origins flavors white peach earl grey rooibos jalinga estate assam wild thai green all unique delicious br okay wait one last important thing is quality tea leaves are whole not crushed smell from bag is amazing but taste is br would highly recommend this product friends br update charlie ritchie tea runner contacted me directly concerning billing error on their end that had not caught that s true customer service \n just got first shipment original so thrilled could wait until tried all them write review been in tea rut while since two loose leaf shops in area both closed down within year each other was excited try new br br first they shipped october in plenty time me get at beginning month since just subscribed that seems like pretty good response time october consists four offerings so far have only gotten try one them but in love already about other three brew own kombucha at home so fully intend use fujian black they sent that purpose although will try hot as normal before do but plain unflavored black tea is generally favorite so most likely this will be used brew one have drank at time writing this review is simao spring tips like lot more than expected bag describes as having notes sweet potato caramel nuts fruits spices that is not bad description this tea at all huge fan goguma sweet potato lattes this remind me lot those especially when mixed with bit heavy cream third bag is kathmandu cosmos which is described as being chai blend addicted chai so ca wait try this one last is pacific peppermint described as an herbal tea will be nice have some peppermint around again especially with weather starting cool br br love speed these came in amount got price tend be bit picky when comes tea paid more money less product sometimes gotten less enjoyment from some those past buys according literature in packaging tea runners will be coming soon amazon prime so hoping that means if there is sample like be able order in larger amounts at some point in br br update this review if anything particularly funky happens with test sips other three teas but if have updated in few days assume best early but so far highly recommend this subscription \n"}

easy share with friends been recommending everywhere br br will probably stay subscribed forever br br on aug br br well guess jinxed because was subscribed no longer exists been good few months now yeah they discontinued line in favor creating bigger more expensive under different name with even less really sad about this as loved subscription benefited massively from but really do see much value in alternative they put out there so have officially say goodbye facetory real shame but suppose this gives me an opportunity find something else fill skincare void in life good luck everyone \n

discontinued monthly coffee subscription this duo enjoyed both coffee cookies last month looking forward treat in few days \n we love our coffee so far received some really nice samples both coffee cookies \n coffee cookies really are perfectly paired also there s plenty coffee last several days me anyway cookies are not your classics like chocolate chip whatnot they are original love this subscription \n wow coffees cookies are sooo delicious what treat get this every suspense what flavor coffee cookie will be br love this is what call real \n passed this forward they were pleased \n in never ending search more more more organic coffee stumbled into this subscription tried other subscription coffees on amazon those that will not be named here but they did not offer organic coffee with one service you may get organic coffee from time time with other service there was just no br idea getting cookies paired with great roast organic coffee seems like perfect combo with only negative thing being that leaves me wanting more more more br cookies are always bakery fresh individually sealed they are decent size always taste amazing every cookie that have had date from this service is always fresh delicious leaves me wanting br coffee is where at was main focus while do not like any flavored coffee always love trying different roasts coffee from different places amazes me how coffee can taste so different even though from outside just coffee fun getting with bright green shredded paper packaging every month filled with small packages which is now bigger package coffee br coffee comes freshly ground sealed in pouch do notice any valves on these pouches release gas that ground coffee can emit but given that is so freshly ground you will probably drink up fast guess this is big deal believe coffee would last year as they do seem be vacuum sealed with no room anything get in there or out until you break open seal inhale fragrant freshly roasted coffee do think there is any better smell than ground coffee maybe fresh baked cookies no on second thought coffee smells better is so much better you usually depending on how you enjoy your coffee \n been wanting an opportunity try different types coffee without major investment or expense this subscription came up as was exploring other subscription boxes looking at description price figured had nothing lose so br br first has arrived was bit rocky start as there seemed be some confusion with package tracker appreciate that coffee is packaged properly in resealable packet cookies were nice surprise bigger than anticipated they survived shipping during heat br br coffee love can be bit subjective each blend roast wo be favorite everyone this first blend was nice but not sure look on own will be interesting see what comes next br br if you are looking an economical way try new flavors this might be what you are looking \n mother in law loves getting hers every month always surprise what kind will arrive father in law enjoys cookies with her \n coffees are good do show nice variety if you go by standardized cup markings on side most coffee pots got about cups out each packet would probably be about half that number in coffee mugs use about scoop every two cups make if you like your coffee stronger you get less out packet despite fact that they are do have any complaints about freshness bags are sealed at least as well as any commercial coffee are according company freshly ground few days before you receive br br update when this review was written you got packets each with different coffee per month each packet made cups matched cookie was included each packet now you get packet per month that makes about cups two cookies same type same amount stuff you got before but single larger quantity match may be more convenient br br cookies are very good packaged cookie have an interesting combination ingredients making them bit more unique than simple chocolate chip or sugar cookie they seem be fresh baked cookie that is sealed in plastic wrapper then shipped by time they get you they have dried out little but they are still very good as size they just little bit smaller than rim plain white coffee mug that not huge but more than br br only complaint is that took full weeks after date that amazon placed order package arrive company that seems be trying ship fresh product that little slow not sure how much this is impacting freshness but is br br note that order date was even earlier amazon places orders once month which means your order is also delayed until about month not complaining about because does affect freshness product gather made fresh after amazon order is placed you do have be very aware total time frame if you planning make gift this though \n s fun anticipate arrival pairing kenyan coffee this month is good but unremarkable cookie is balsamic rosemary with little black pepper works but don t think ve met cookie didn t like m already looking forward arrival december s \n"}

\n have gotten boxes already love them love quality makeup assortment products is always great fun useful not moisturizers mascaras like have gotten in other boxes packaging is so pretty this months was pink with stars so s like getting beautiful fabulous present in mailbox every month would recommend this makeup this subscription anyone \n was very pleased when opened first medusa makeup very generous sizes great lip colors matte lip color stays on all day rich pigment all products are great can use everything in this \n super pretty make up bought this daughter she loved \n loved variety colors but br this would be better kid or younger that just wants play with makeup with mom like quality is few steps above costume makeup \n got june was amazing loved everything in br can tell you that this is more creative people out there who love vibrant crazy colors only down side was fell apart from travel guess rained at one point was kinda blinded on products but did some research was all good \n mascara was definitely not favorite too small brush everything else loved \n while this wasn t what was looking still had quality products full size \n amazing products got first didn t dissapointed me \n ordered our yr old daughter this as monthly subscription gift valentine s day she loves she is on her month now has loved products she didn t get cute canvas bag at all as shown in picture comes in pink metallic style postal package which is cute \n received second sub from medusa today both boxes have received thus far have arrived in good condition timely manner products themselves are very fun medusa does sometimes have some rather outlandish colors but so far me everything have received is working out well \n loved packaging fact products are vegan however colors were not old luckily she has preteen daughter who loves lipstick she was able give this item her think as purchaser would say is fantastic gift idea younger girls price what you get is very good think is personal choice when comes color unfortunately missed mark only because color \n am really enjoying mascara on daily basis since got other products are very nice too going get next month \n ve noticed most bad reviews this on here are people saying this should be kids they weren t wanting bright neon makeup colors well that s what this brand is known they do great job if you don t like bright colors trying new products that are often bit daring then this is not you however am years old absolutely love glitters bright colors often featured in this they apply beautifully can be worn subtly if you know apply them will say their monthly boxes can be hit or miss so usually like see what s going be featured in their boxes month before commit buy through amazon which is so easy do on here compared through their site example their december was huge hit me pictured but just wasn t feeling their january so ll likely pick up again in february love that they re cruelty free brand they do have wonderful innovative products definitely would recommend other makeup obsessed people who aren t afraid use bright shades \n so cosmetologist here makeup addict ve tried all luxury drugstore will say being pink haired babe am not afraid color if you re like minded human love all things neon or smokey this is you if you re neutral lover wouldn t recommend \n love medusa s makeup ve been using years \n just got our first sharing with daughter we were really excited about everything included in we have used products just yet but are looking forward doing so she snagged pretty glitter liquid eyeshadow am going try out matte liquid lipstick there was also cucumber facemask witch hazel hibiscus facial spray toner we may need start getting separate each us so that can keep all products lol \n love concept enjoyed few products so far some weren t that great s personal didn t enjoy color lipstick but can t wouldn t dock any stars that overall looking forward next \n sharing with daughter something both generations \n april s kit am vegan was happy find subscription company dedicated supplying items like these like selection in this package lip gloss medusa s disco queen in boogie nights is favorite am lighter skinned went well with tone mascara worked short time that had on ll have test longer moisturizer feels just right light not sticky eyeshadow didn t go on as purple as seemed would fortunately was more bruised look coffee scrub not shown bonus bonus is supposed be dry as s use \n get so happy seeing these packages in mail such sweet treat \n love this there great variety do understand why someone would be upset that they getting crazy colors go look at their website before subscribing yes you will get bright interesting colors gotten several

particular scene but name is literally movie moments was in that moment when lukes feared progressed surface us viewer so see this frozen in time as funko is awesome \n was gift brother hes big chewy fan had him open in front me he loved came with shirt pop mini pop cool glass mostly loved because was wookie theme \n this was better than previous ones because contained hopefully will be included in more boxes that s what everyone wants \n great value \n most part really liked boxes got in particular liked darth vader dagobah themes think in minority when comes liking movie moments but love star wars is original trilogy so thought dagobah movie moment was awesome anyway enjoyed surprise in these boxes if you think you like theme think you like what br br one last thing packaging in these boxes is at times terrible does seem that they addressed this because last or two has been packed better but in earlier boxes there were loose items flying around causing damage pop boxes they were really careless in packing boxes last couple were packed much better so maybe they taking seriously now \n this dagobah is first smuggler bounty really love yoda mystery mini is really detailed cool movie moment is awesome as well sticky notes decal seemed more like filler but they are still cool would prefer individual pop maybe next time overall like ca wait see wookiee in april \n what fun \n awesome combo \n daughter loves these we have purchased more as they are so much fun great quality items are inside really fun all star wars fans \n simply love but we need more br that part magic

loved boba fett carbonite han pop figurine \n someone told was going suck so wasn t in rush open but had good time opening s first one so don t know what other ones are like pint glass was pretty heavy not like pint glasses you can buy in stores so liked that most important item pop figure loved because liked that scene in empire strikes back someone mentioned how they how they need do leia han now that would be awesome little with mini figure was whatever liked shirt even though don t plan on wearing price wise what got can go if wasn t chewbacca fan would probably be upset m debating on getting next one darth vader go back forth but pop in that one could be cool we will see \n good products love surprises \n love shirt figures \n funko pops came in perfect condition so star wars collector like was super excited with lando kalrissian pop detail on helmet mouth piece was amazing actually like klaatu skiff gaurd pop as well surprisingly mini pop was cool this theme thought shot glasses let call with they are were nice touch gave them mother add her shot class collection from places she traveled overall think this bounty was best one so far looking fwd dagobah smuggler bounty \n go star wars geek \n so cute really cute assortment in these boxes we received cups figurines bottle opener bobble heads etc \n loved everything chewbacca theme great quality made day coming home seeing there waiting me lol its little stuff like that that make your day better so excited next one \n no damage on pop br good fast day shipping \n year old son loved he even wants keep play with \n what else would you expect from darth vader themed other than some darth vader funko darth vader full size mini funko are cool but bit boring shirt is also bit boring am your father quote on shirt would have been more appropriate if was on time fathers day final item was total let down bottle opener with darth vader styled handle bottle opener will take too much explaining even fans br br other extra items in past chewbacca pint glass or previous boxes holder do not require an explanation having explain really takes something away from will cause be unused relegated back br br still all in all is decent definitely still worth money am hoping that pod racer themed packs little more wow factor \n there pretty cool enjoy opening them up \n nice \n son lives getting these \n each is full

dishes from around world ethiopian we received this month they were super excited make we enjoyed delicious dinner we are looking forward seeing what we get next month \n so far we absolutely love our boxes both kids have really enjoyed helping cook each meal daughter who is very picky eater is actually trying some things she normally would not touch each meal has been really delicious husband actually says he feels like he eating in restaurant when we sit down eat meals been so fun learning about different countries our last was singapore while we waited some chicken marinade we watched bunch youtube videos about what life is like in singapore been great learning experience all us highly recommend these boxes all marinades spices have been so yummy actually wish we could order more marinades spices off website because we definitely want make some dishes again great experience lot family fun \n recipes were clear unusual am an adult cook thoroughly enjoyed this \n so never write reviews think have written one but was not positive one but just had say how awesome this is this month was brazil love food now will have something fun look forward every month ca travel anymore cause going out eat is pretty much so this fills that little hole in heart plus going add this in our homeschooling efforts kid info sheets were awesome fun trivia learning about not just cuisine but so much more about country have been tired from organizing so much home entertainment is nice get an organized that pretty much does me thanks would highly recommend subscribing this \n stars because itself is cute fun but order directly from website because amazon sends you previous month got delivered in october but was september ethiopia they do some choice which country based around special events in that month so stinks get learn all about that has already br br definitely cool activity \n family has been doing over year now we started on amazon then switched over actual company site we have really enjoyed doing have liked all recipes has been great experience our kids we love trying all new dishes exploring other cultures through cuisine paired some meals up with our country study in home school we do think is bit expensive what you get noticed reviewer saying that you get one packet spices which is not accurate you usually get three or four packets sometimes bottles spices seasonings sauces etc you also get small kitchen tool along with recipes shopping lists if you sign up through their site they sometimes offer deals we have done year subscription with black friday discount two years in row now currently on our second year we have been disappointed this year as we have been receiving duplicate boxes past meals because this we have decided not do year subscription next year looked at their site as now they only add new boxes every year price we did want kits that we have already done these kits are in no way cheap meal they provide recipes harder find seasonings you provide pantry staple seasonings all food they are exploring other cultures other parts might add we only did few months through amazon then full year now into our second year we have already received duplicate boxes past kits each kit has recipes several meals but we make them all at once invite other family join us everyone has loved meals sad not do in future but there just are enough meal kits sustain keeping subscription their customer service has been good when we received broken spice packets etc recommend this anyone who wants make try new foods not cheap though so would keep that in mind every kit offers vegetarian alternatives with recipes which is nice \n is very unique subscription families was waiting food that could make w baby will say that price just getting shopping list some computer printouts was little cheap but again ca find another geared family cook family friendly meals together they are extremely easy make follow directions we did receive ethiopia which is extra unique so we excited try little cautious but super optimistic will add update after we buy ingredients because all comes with is br br update well meals are yummy got next months after careful evaluation what you actually get feel that value is not there you really are only getting some computer printouts about some history said country which with w little extra work google you could probably incorporate this into family meal learn lot some spice packets which again sorry but after some more research found with just spices which is under ten bucks which put this in perspective did ultimately cancel subscription but did enjoy boxes did br br hope this helps \n our year old twins have had fantastic time prepping meals with their dad father s day gift flavors have been amazing wonderful young families \n"}
